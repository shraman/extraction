essential hypertension; supine or standing diastolic blood pressure 90- 120 mm Hg
1. primary hip fracture occurring in the community 2. people > 65 years old 3. independent pre-fracture walking function 4. community dwelling 5. intact cognitive status
clinical diagnosis of hip fracture . surgery treatment . postoperative anaemia 6-7 mmol/L up to the 6th day post operation . aged  65 years . admitted from nursing home or sheltered housing facilities for unilateral hip fracture surgery . written assent
clinically stable, diagnosis of moderate-to-severe COPD according to Amer- ican Thoracic Society criteria, completed pulmonary rehabilitation in the last year, not had previous rol- lator use, unassisted 6MW distance <375 m
clinical stability; moderate to severe COPD; no previously prescribed walking aid; unaided 6MW < 375 m; completed pulmonary rehabilitation programme
postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed hormone receptor- positive MBC or LABC defined as ER and/or PgR  10 fmol/mg cytosol protein, or 10% of the tumour cells positive as assessed by immunohistochemical evaluation of the primary tumour. For the trastuzumab and control arms, the primary tumour had to reveal HER2 over-expression defined as 3+ staining by IHC or HER2 amplification (ratio > 2) by FISH or an equivalent method. No prior treatment for metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer; LVEF  50% at baseline; adequate hepatic, renal and bone marrow function; an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Furthermore, patients were required to have at least 1 measurable tumour lesion (patients with bone only disease were eligible) 
postmenopausal women over-expressing HER2/neu by the Hercep Test assay (score 2+ or 3+), and/or fluorescence in situ hybridisation positive with two-fold amplification, hormone receptor-positive (ER-positive and/or PgR-positive). Previous treatment with tamoxifen as adjuvant or hormonal therapy or anastrozole was permitted. Other requirements included a LVEF greater than 50%; adequate baseline hepatic, renal and bone marrow function; an ECOG performance status of 0 to 1; and measurable or evaluable disease 
NYHA class II or III, a resting EF ?35% measured by echocardiography or gated equilibrium radionuclide angiography, and no change in medical therapy ?30 days before randomisation
participants between 18-65 years of age undergoing a primary heart transplant with a cold ischaemia time < 6 h
all adult participants listed for heart transplantation between June 2001 and April 2005
COPD; clinically stable; between 55 and 85 y; unaccustomed of a walking aid
Exudative AMD in one eye (defined as angiographic evidence of classic or occult choroidal neovascularisation or RPE detachment) and early ARM with visual acuity 20/40 or better in other eye (early ARM: macular drusen with no angiographic evidence of exudative lesion).

women with pathologically confirmed, HER2-positive, locally ad- vanced or metastatic breast cancer. HER2 status was considered positive if over-expres- sion was detected in either the primary or metastatic tumour tissue by local immunohis- tochemistry (grade 3+ staining intensity) or by fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Du- ration of previous trastuzumab treatment had to be 12 weeks or greater, and the time since the end of the last trastuzumab cycle had to be less than 6 weeks. Patients could have received up to 1 chemotherapy drug for metastatic disease. Karnofsky performance status of 60% or greater; a life expectancy of greater than 3 months; and adequate hae- matologic, renal, hepatic and cardiac function sonographically confirmed by a LVEF of 50% or greater.
