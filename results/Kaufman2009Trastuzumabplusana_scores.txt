Several clinical studies have established that patients with ER-positive and HER2-positive primary tumors experience relapse sooner and experience a signif- icantly shorter TTP after hormonal therapy than patients whose tumors are only ER positive.17,18,37 Recent evidence also suggests that HER2 overexpression abrogates the effect of AIs on tu- mor proliferation.38,39 TAnDEM required that all patients should have hormone receptor–positive tumors by local testing; however, central retest- ing, undertaken as an internal control, revealed that 21% of pa- tients had centrally confirmed ER/PgR-negative tumors.

Moreover, lower hor- mone receptor expression in HER2/hormone receptor– copositive disease may confound the reliability of hormone receptor test results.41 As expected, compared with the overall population, me- dian PFS, TTP, and OS times in both treatment arms were slightly longer in the subgroup with centrally confirmed hormone receptor positivity.

The findings in the anastrozole alone arm can only be compared with historic data from an HER2/hormone receptor– copositive subgroup (n87) in a study of letrozole alone in MBC where median TTP was 6.1 months (compared with 2.4 months in TAnDEM) and CBR was 33% (compared with 28% in TAnDEM).42 The numbers of AEs and SAEs were higher with trastuzumab plus anastrozole compared with anastrozole alone; however, it should be considered that duration of treatment was longer in the trastu- zumab plus anastrozole arm.

Because tumors that are HER2/hormone receptor– copositive are likely to progress sooner on hormonal therapy alone than HER2-negative, hormone receptor–positive tumors, combining hormonal therapy and trastuzumab may be expected to maximize clinical benefit.

However, it is a matter of debate whether patients with HER2/hormone receptor–copositive disease should re- ceive hormonal therapy or whether they might be more logically and simply treated with the standard first-line treatment option for HER2- positive MBC of trastuzumab plus a taxane.10,11,43 This is an area for future research.

Patients who received trastuzumab plus anastrozole had statisti- cally significant improvement in the primary end point of PFS, and separation of the curves occurred relatively early.
score --> 1
In fact, median PFS in the anastrozole alone arm was only 2.4 months, and the prolongation to 4.8 months with the addition of trastu- zumab represents an actual improvement of 100%.

The relatively short PFS is likely explained by the aggressive nature of HER2/ hormone receptor– copositive tumors compared with HER2-neg- ative/hormone receptor–positive tumors.

With patients recruited from 77 centers in 22 countries worldwide, as expected,40 some discordance occurred as a result of different IHC methodologies and scoring systems used.

The magnitude of the difference in favor of adding trastuzumab to anastrozole for both PFS and TTP (1.8 and 1.7 months, respectively) remained statistically significant.
score --> 1
Moreover, AE over-reporting may have occurred in patients on trastuzumab plus anastrozole because they went to the hospital for weekly infusions as well as for study assessments.
