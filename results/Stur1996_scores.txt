The fact that we did not observe functional deterioration in the eyes in which exudative lesions did not develop also agrees with study results investigating the natural course of AMD, which showed tfiat visual deterioration caused by exudative lesions could occur at any stage of AMD, whereas deterioration of visual acuity caused by atrophic alterations is found only in late stages of AMD.6-22"24 Unfortunately, Newsome and coworkers3 did not use a standardized grading protocol, which prevented an exact comparison of their study patients and ours.

MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients underwent ophthalmologic examinations immediately before study entry and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after the start of treatment.

Nonfasting blood samples were collected before the start of therapy and after 6 and 24 months, always at 1 PM, and included serum levels of zinc and copper as well as other laboratory tests (complete blood cell count, blood electrolytes, and chemistry) to detect any copper deficiency and its consequences (e.g., hypochromic ane- mia) that might be caused by the zinc intake.

RESULTS One hundred twelve patients were enrolled between March 1, 1990 and June 30, 1992.
score --> 0
Six patients (four in the treatment group, two in the placebo group) could not tolerate the medication because of gastroin- testinal side effects and had to be withdrawn from the study.

Fourteen patients did not return for the scheduled follow-up visits or decided to withdraw from the study because of personal reasons.

Monitoring was conducted by the sponsor (Astra), who made a statistical calculation after the first 40 patients finished the 24-month follow-up period to determine whether there was a detectable trend.

Two results of the evaluation of serum levels of zinc and copper and several test results of red blood count and hemoglobin were unobtainable; therefore, only hematologic test re- sults from 66 patients and zinc and copper test results from 80 patients could be included in the statistical anal- ysis.

Before the start of treatment, serum levels of zinc of all tested patients were in the normal range (study range, 80 ± 14 i^g/dl; normal range, 68 to 136 /ig/dl), and there was no significant difference between groups.
score --> 0
In the treatment group, the mean serum zinc levels after 6 months and after 24 months of treatment were signifi- cantly higher than before the start of treatment and were significantly higher than those of the placebo group.

In neither group was there a significant change in serum copper levels, red blood cell counts, and hemoglobin values when we performed an analysis of variance for between-treatment differences during the treatment pe- riod.

Although all parameters showed a significant increase over time, there was no difference between treatment and placebo groups (Table 6).
