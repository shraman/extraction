We previously found postoperative anemia after hip fracture surgery to be an independent predictor of post- operative inability to walk independently and postopera- tive Hb level was also positively correlated with the ambulation score.10 Hb level has been found to be an inde- pendent predictor for distance walked at discharge, and anemia on discharge has been found to be predictive of readmission.8-9,17 The only previous randomized study of 644 patients admitted to  hip fracture unit during  inclusion period  144 patients not included due to  unavailability of investigators  357 patients not fulfilling inclusion criteria   61 < 65 years old   61 With cognitive dysfunction   98 Nursing home residence   25 Not independent in walking   35 Fracture during prior hospitalization   16 With multiple fractures   6   Pre-fracture terminal   22 Acute cardiac condition pre-inclusion   12 Other acute medical condition pre-inclusion   9  Contraindication to epidural analgesia   6  Alcoholism   3  Chronic transfusion need   3  Surgical immobilization orders 23 patients declined  participation  120 patients included  60 patients randomized to liberal  transfusion threshold  1 mobilization restrictions   3 acute ward transfer   2 reoperation  54 included in per protocol analysis  60 patients randomized to restrictive  transfusion threshold  2 mobilization restrictions   4 acute ward transfer   1 reoperation  53 included in per protocol analysis  Fig.

H ip fracture surgery is associated with peri- operative blood loss leading to anemia, which in the elderly patient is associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality.1-4 In addition, postoperative anemia leads to increased cardiac demand and tissue hypoxia,5 and hemo- globin (Hb) levels below 8.0 g per dL have been associated with increased postoperative mortality.6 However, moder- ate anemia in hip fracture patients with Hb levels between 8.0 and 10.0 g per L has not been demonstrated to increase mortality in hip fracture patients, but has been associated with decreased postoperative ambulation.7-10 Anemia has been shown to decrease functional outcome and increase morbidity and mortality, but the correction of moderate anemia with red blood cell (RBC) transfusions has not been shown to improve either reha- bilitation or morbidity outcomes.11 As such, the optimal transfusion threshold in elderly hip fracture patients is controversial.

Study variables Medical conditions, American Society of Anesthesiolo- gists (ASA) classification, type of surgery, and residential status were recorded.Mental status was assessed by a vali- dated 9-point Danish version of the abbreviated mental status test taken upon admission.14 Functional level pre- fracture were assessed with the new mobility score.15 During the physiotherapy session the patients were evaluated on their ambulatory capacity via the CAS,15 which allows day to day measurements of functional mobility in hip fracture patients in the early postoperative phase.

Transfusions can be immunosup- pressive and have been linked to increased risk of bacterial infections in hip fracture patients, although this is controversial.27-29 We did find a tendency toward an increased incidence of wound infections in the liberal group, but no difference in overall incidence of infectious complications was found; this outcome is most likely not influenced by the distribution of surgical procedures between the groups.30 The present data do not allow us to conclude finally on the safety of restrictive transfusion thresholds in the elderly hip fracture patient with or without cardiac comor- bidity thereby calling for larger well-designed randomized studies with mortality as a primary outcome measure.

LIBERAL VERSUS RESTRICTIVE TRANSFUSION THRESHOLDS AND HIP FRACTURE SURGERY Volume 49, February 2009 TRANSFUSION 231 transfusion on mortality has been found in hip fracture patients with a Hb level of more than 80 g per L.4,17 The previous randomized study of transfusion thresholds in hip fracture patients compared a threshold of a Hb level of less than 100 g per L with a threshold of less than 80 g per L or “symptomatic anemia,” and showed a similar trend toward improved survival with the liberal transfusion trigger—a relative risk of 2.5, compared to 2.1 in the present study.11 Despite a significantly higher mortality in the restrictive transfusion group, the findings should be interpreted with caution both due to the fact that the skewed distribution of patients with an ASA score of 3 between groups may have confounded the result and due to the fact that mortality was a second- ary outcome measure, which the study was not initially powered to detect.

Since it is not known to which extent cardiovascular disease is under- diagnosed in this group of patients, the decision to transfuse should probably reflect this.26 It is also of importance to note that the hip fracture population included in a study such as this repre- sents the fittest part of the population and that any negative effects seen will potentially be amplified if implemented in the general hip fracture population where the degree of medical comorbid- ity is even higher.

These types of surgery that are used in pertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures have been shown to be independent predic- tors of increased perioperative blood loss; they are associated with higher pain levels, a decreased ability to inde- pendent ambulation, poorer rehabi- litation outcome, and increased mortality.1,16,20-23 In the restrictive group, there also were a significantly higher number of patients receiving screws/ pins—the procedure associated with the least blood loss.1 This could explain the fact that despite a higher number of transfusions in the liberal group, mean Hb values were actually very close in the perioperative period, confounding the impact of the liberal transfusion therapy.
score --> 2
A continued blood loss into the postoperative period was evident, as patients in the liberal transfusion group continued to become anemic despite transfusions, as documented in previ- ous studies.1 Moderate anemia has been asso- ciated with increased mortality in patients over 65 years old undergoing noncardiac surgery, but no effect of RBC TABLE 1.

There was a trend toward improved CAS in patients with arthroplasty in the liberal transfu- sion group, although this was not sig- nificant (p = 0.07).

There were no differences in rehabilita- tion outcome on an intention-to-treat basis.

There was a higher rate of cardio- vascular complications in the restrictive transfusion group (2% vs. 10%; p = 0.05) and a higher 30-day mortality (0% vs. 8%; p = 0.02; relative risk, 2.1 [1.5-2.5]); there was no significant difference between infectious complications in the two groups, although there was a trend toward a higher incidence of wound infections (p = 0.08) in the liberal group.

We did, however, find an increased morbidity in the form of car- diovascular events and an increased mortality in the restrictive transfusion group.

Patients received a multi- modal rehabilitation program,3 includ- ing regional anesthesia and analgesia, standardized fluid therapy, nutrition support, supplemental oxygen, and intensive physical therapy as well as day to day nurse care plans.18 Similar programs have been shown to improve physical capacity in other types of sur- gery compared to conventional care.18 Pain is associated with poor ambulation and rehabilitation outcomes and regional analgesia has been shown to reduce pain as a limiting factor in rehabilitation.13,19,20 As such, our setup should optimize conditions to define and isolate the influence of transfusion thresholds on rehabilitation.

Unfortu- nately our randomization resulted in a significant higher proportion of patients with either SHS or IMHS in the liberal transfusion group.

Existing cardiovascular disease has been shown to increase the risk of perio- perative anemia.3 Regional analgesia with epidural local anesthetics reduces preoperative cardiac complications and minimizes postoperative ischemia, and as such, our perioperative setup should theoretically decrease the risk of cardiac complications.13,24,25 We found a signifi- cantly higher rate of cardiac complica- tions in the restrictive threshold group compared to the liberal group, despite no significant difference in existing cardiovascular disease.
