Capecitabine is an oral prodrug of the antimetabolite fluororu- racil; it is frequently used in patients with metastatic breast cancer after taxane treatment and provides consistent response rates and accept- able toxicity.11,12 The combination of capecitabine and trastuzumab showed a clinical benefit rate of 63% to 70% in heavily pretreated patients with HER-2–positive advanced breast cancer.4,13 We conducted this phase III trial to assess whether patients who were treated with trastuzumab beyond progression and second-line chemotherapy experienced a longer time to progression than those treated with chemotherapy alone.
score --> 10
In vitro laboratory experiments did not identify fluorouracil as additive or synergistic with trastuzumab.24 However, in-tumor xeno- graft models of capecitabine and trastuzumab had at least additive antitumor activity in vivo.25 One might speculate that trastuzumab beyond progression will be even more efficacious with other chemo- therapeutic drugs, like platinum compounds.26 In conclusion, these data confirm a statistically and clinically significant improved response and time to progression for the continuation of trastuzumab beyond progression in the manage- ment of women with HER-2–positive advanced breast cancer.

Methods Patients with HER-2–positive breast cancer that progresses during treatment with trastuzumab were randomly assigned to receive capecitabine (2,500 mg/m2 body-surface area on days 1 through 14 [1,250 mg/m2 semi-daily]) alone or with continuation of trastuzumab (6 mg/kg body weight) in 3-week cycles.
score --> 8
Conclusion Continuation of trastuzumab plus capecitabine showed a significant improvement in overall response and time to progression compared with capecitabine alone in women with HER-2– positive breast cancer who experienced progression during trastuzumab treatment.
score --> 8
Preclinical data indicate that trastuzumab is effective against tumor cell proliferation as long as it is present, whereas trastuzumab withdrawal re- sults in rapid tumor cell regrowth.1,2 In addition, trastuzumab significantly enhances the antitumor effect of taxanes in tumors that progress with trastuzumab alone.3 Clinical evidence on treatment with trastu- zumab beyond progression either alone or with a switch to a different chemotherapy is based, so far, on various retrospective analyses.4-7 However, these results might be biased as a result of unknown fac- tors that influence physicians’ decisions to stop or to continue trastuzumab.

Random assignment was stratified by pretreatment (ie, taxanes and trastuzumab as adjuvant treatment, taxanes and trastu- zumab as first-line treatment for metastatic disease, and trastuzumab alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents other than capecitabine or taxanes as first-line treatment) and by participating center.

Tras- tuzumab can induce an immune-mediated, target-cell killing by antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity.2,18-20 Our hypothe- sis is that, under the selective pressure of continuous antibody expo- sure, breast cancer cells are able to bypass the antiproliferative action of trastuzumab but leave a chemotherapy-sensitizing mechanism in- tact.

in Europe to investigate trastuzumab beyond progression in prospec- tive randomized trials have failed, to date, because a strong prevision by physicians and patients for the superiority of this approach resulted in insufficient accrual.8 Recently, lapatinib, a small molecule that inhibits the tyrosine kinases of HER-2 and the epidermal growth factor receptor type 1 (ie, EGFR, HER-1, ErbB-1), in combination with capecitabine was superior to capecitabine in patients previously treated with trastu- zumab.9,10 It is uncertain whether this observation reflects non–cross resistance of the two anti–HER-2 agents or represents a general syner- gism of anti–HER-2 treatments in combination with cytotoxic agents.

capecitabine group probably had an ongoing exposure to trastu- zumab because of the drug’s long half-life.23 This is supported by the shape of the curves (Fig 2A) for time to progression, which does not separate for the first 3 months, and by the overall response rate that is higher than those reported previously for capecitabine alone.11,12 Also, a potential bias in assessment of response rates by the unblinded investigator can not be excluded.

Overall response rates were 27.0% with capecitabine and 48.1% with capecitabine plus trastuzumab (odds ratio, 2.50; P  .0115).

Continuation of trastuzumab beyond progression was not associated with increased toxicity.

It is not known whether this holds true for novel biologic agents like trastuzumab (Herceptin; Roche, Grenzach- Wyhlen, Germany), a humanized monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of hu- man epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER-2, also referred to as HER-2/neu or ErbB- 2).

Because no central assessment of response was performed, potential risk of a bias caused by the unblinded investigator might have existed.

Duration of response was defined as the time period between first notification of a response and the date of documented progression, disease-related death, or withdrawal.

Toxicity was assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria ver- sion 2.0.
score --> 1
A one-sided significance test and a 5% type-I error, a statistical power of 80%, and a drop-out rate of 10% were chosen, as the addition of trastu- zumab was not expected to diminish the effect of capecitabine.

A Cox proportional hazards model was fit to adjust for prognostic factors that influenced time to progression.

Because the second interim analysis was not performed, the significance level for the final analysis was taken at   .0467, which corresponded to a second analysis in a two-stage O’Brian-Fleming sequence.

Continued response to therapy in the face of treatment failure is something of a paradox.
score --> 1
Most anticancer drugs work predominantly through an antiproliferative effect.
score --> 1
Trastuzumab clearly demon- strates such an antiproliferative effect that is mediated through inhibition of HER-2 signaling in preclinical models.2 This leads to alterations in cell cycle regulators,15 reduced activity of DNA repair pathways,2,16 and HER-2–mediated antiangiogenic activity.17 How- ever, the chemotherapy-sensitizing mechanism of trastuzumab1,2 likely depends on specific capabilities of monoclonal antibodies.

The results con- sistently show superior efficacy of continuation of trastuzumab in the adjusted and sensitivity analyses.
