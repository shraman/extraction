Subjects were approached if they met the following inclusion criteria: clinical stability, a diagnosis of moderate to severe COPD4 (a forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity ratio of G0.7 and a forced expiratory volume in 1 second of G59%), no previously prescribed walking aid, unaided 6MW of G375 m, and completed a pulmonary rehabilitation program.

Among individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), walking is an important, useful, and preferred form of exercise.1 Therefore, most pulmonary rehabilitation programs include walking both as part of their exercise training program and as a way of evaluating functional exercise capacity.2,3 In COPD, dyspnea is the cardinal symptom that limits exercise.4 Consequently, many approaches to the management of patients with COPD, such as the prescription of bronchodilators, are aimed at relieving dyspnea.

However, performance on the 6MW has been shown to closely parallel the level of activity that individuals are likely to perform in their daily lives.18 In Ontario, Canada, the number of ambulation aids funded between 1999 and 2004 has remained quite consistent, between 19,400 and 22,900, of which 73% to 87% were for those aged over 65 years, and of these 25% had respiratory diagnoses (Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care, Assistive Devices Program, .............................................................................................................

h METHODS: Thirty-one stable subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (13 men, 18 women), aged 68 T 8 years, with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 0.7 T 0.2 L (33% T 12% predicted) and a baseline 6-minute walk (6MW) of 261 T 68 m, were recruited from a respiratory clinic after completion of a pulmonary rehabilitation program.

h CONCLUSIONS: Rollator use resulted in improvements in performance in the 6MW, which were consistent over time among individuals with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who walk less than 375 m during an unaided 6MW.
score --> 7
In a recent study, the results of paired 6MW among patients with severe COPD showed that for impaired patients with reduced walking ability, the rollator in- creased their 6MW from 220 T 12 to 242 T 14 m (P = .02), with shorter rest time and less dyspnea compared with walking unaided.11 An outstanding issue with regard to testing for the effectiveness of a rollator is whether the results of a single pair of 6MW tests are sufficient.

A rollator is a walker with 4 wheels, equipped with swivel castors in the front 2 wheels, hand brakes, a basket for carrying objects, and a seat that allows the user to rest.5 Several prior reports have noted that rollator use is associated with a reduction in dyspnea and an increase in functional exercise capacity.6Y12 There are a variety of mechanisms by which the rollator assists walking, K E Y W O R D S COPD functional exercise capacity pulmonary rehabilitation rollator walk test From the Graduate Department of Rehabilitation Science (Ms Gupta and Dr Brooks), Departments of Physical Therapy (Dr Goldstein and Dr Brooks), and Medicine (Dr Goldstein), University of Toronto; West Park HealthCare Centre (Dr Goldstein and Dr Brooks), Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

The Acute Effects of a Rollator in Individuals With COPD Renu Gupta, MSc; Roger Goldstein, FRCP (C); Dina Brooks, PhD ................................................................................................................................................................................................................. h PURPOSE: To investigate whether the acute benefits of rollator use are consistent over time in individuals with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Two 6MWs were performed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks, one walking unaided and the other walking with the assistance of a rollator.

More recently, it has become customary in some pulmonary rehabilitation programs to request that the patient undergo two 6-minute walks (6MWs), supervised by a member of the healthcare team, one with a rollator and the other without a rollator.
