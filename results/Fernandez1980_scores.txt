Chiorothiazide, a well established diuretic, lowers the blood pressure with continued administration when the dietary intake of salt is restricted.1 The precise mechanisms by which diuretics and dietary salt re- striction lower the blood pressure are not entirely understood.

In analysing the blood pressures without treatment before the trial measured with the patients lying down and the changes in blood pressure with the various treatments, we found that most of the correlation co- efficients were significantly different from zero (P < 0.05), whereas the regression lines were not signif- icant because of the high variation (Fig.

The absence of decreases in the blood pressures after chlorothiazide treatment and the lack of a significant difference between the response to a-methyldopa and the response to the combination could be attributed to the traditionally high salt intake (15 to 20 g a day) of the patients.12 DahP3 repeatedly emphasized the merit of modest restriction of the salt in a patient's diet in controlling the blood pressure.

However, a similar study of the same design com- paring placebo with a-methyldopa and hydrochioro- thiazide alone and in combination has been carried out.2 We found statistically significant decreases in the blood pressures with the patients standing after treat- ment wtih a-methyldopa alone or in combination with chlorothiazide.

It could be postulated that the de- creases were predominantly the result of the anti- hypertensive efficacy of a-methyldopa, for the dose of chlorothiazide may have been too low to cause detectable changes in blood pressure.
score --> 3
The routine suggestions to hypertensive patients to adhere to a low-salt diet, correct obesity and cease smoking are rarely effective in controlling the blood pressure except in patients with the mildest hyper- tension.1' Our patients were instructed to keep their dietary intake of salt to less than 2.3 g a day.
score --> 3
Furthermore, in the individual hypertensive patient the fall in blood pressure produced by diuretics is related to the fall attained by moderate sodium restriction;'4 thus, failure to maintain the modest salt restriction could negate the antihypertensive effect of chlorothiazide.

On the other hand, advocates of the combination products contend that any disadvantages are outweighed by the economy, the convenience to the patient and the ease of compliance, the last being an important factor in the successful treatment of hypertension.3 Supres-1 50, a combination of 250 mg of a-methyl- dopa and 150 mg of chlorothiazide, is widely pre- scribed by family physicians in Canada.
