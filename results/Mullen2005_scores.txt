The use of DZM induction could thus lead to a cost savings of between $2,000 and $3,000 in some heart transplant recipients.Our study has demonstrated that DZM was a safe component of induction therapy in heart transplant- ation.

The results of this study support the efficacy of a two dose DZM regimen which is simpler in that patients need not return to hospital for treatment every 2 weeks.
score --> 0
The ATG regimen is more complex than our DZM regimen, requiring 5 to 7 days of continuous intravenous infusion and more steroid administration.
score --> 0
In addition, ATG may have limited use due to the formation of antibodies; therefore, treatment of future rejection episodes may not be possible with ATG.
score --> 0
In this study, both average absolute lymphocyte count and platelet count were significantly reduced in the ATG group compared to the DZM group (Table 3).

In our current study, one patient in the ATG group developed severe thrombocytopenia, however, not in response to the ATG infusion.
score --> 0
The exact mechanism of effect of DZM is unknown; however, the efficacy of DZM is likely related to its se- lective targeting of active T-lymphocytes.

This allows DZM to specifically tar- get the active lymphocytes, leaving the immune system otherwise intact.
score --> 0
This is consistent with our results of higher average absolute lymphocytes in the DZM group.
score --> 0
DZM has also been genetically engineered to contain 90% human determinants.
score --> 0
This reduces the immunogen- icity of the molecule and lengthens its circulating half- life (20 days).
score --> 0
An advantage of DZM’s long half-life is that T-cell rebound after discontinuation of DZM does not occur.
score --> 0
Patients receiving ATG at our center receive a pulse of methylprednisolone at the point of ATG dis- continuation to prevent this T-cell rebound.
score --> 0
Patients in the ATG group therefore required a significantly higher dose of methylprednisolone compared to the DZM group.
score --> 0
Furthermore, because only a fraction of the anti- bodies from ATG are directed against T-lymphocytes, a large amount of volume (10 mg/kg for 5 to 7 days) must be administered.
score --> 0
Total drug cost and hospital ward cost was also less in the DZM group.

Our study highlights the advantages of DZM, including ease of administration, lower cost, higher lymphocyte count, and freedom from excessive platelet destruction.
