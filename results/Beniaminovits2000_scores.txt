adult, consecutive non-sensitized recipients of first cardiac transplants 
Methods   We randomly assigned 55 nonsensitized patients undergoing a first cardiac transplantation to receive either induction therapy with daclizumab (1.0 mg per kilogram of body weight), given intravenously within 24 hours after cardiac transplantation and ev- ery two weeks thereafter, for a total of five doses, or generalized immunosuppressive therapy.

The pur- pose of the current study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of daclizumab with respect to the fre- quency and severity of acute rejection in nonsensi- tized recipients of first cardiac transplants.
score --> 4
DISCUSSION   As compared with generalized immunosuppressive therapy, induction therapy with daclizumab decreased the frequency of rejection, prolonged the time to a first rejection episode in the first three months after cardiac transplantation, and decreased the overall se- verity of rejection.

In addition, as compared with the patients in the control group, those in the daclizumab group were less likely to need rescue therapy with an- tilymphocytic agents, needed less prednisone by the fifth month after transplantation, and were less likely to have immunologic reactivity against the allograft.

Therapy with mon- oclonal or polyclonal antibodies has also been asso- ciated with a greater incidence of opportunistic infec- tion and cancer, probably because of the nonspecific T-cell suppression that results from such treatment.

Frequent side effects, such as the cytokine release syn- drome, allergic reactions, fever, and thrombocytope- nia, also occur with these drugs.

Treatment with daclizumab resulted in a significant reduction in the frequency and severity of rejection during the treatment period, but after the cessation of therapy, the frequency of rejection increased to a level similar to that in the control group.
score --> 0
This finding sug- gests that daclizumab has an immunomodulatory ef- fect that is similar to that of other monoclonal anti- body–based therapies (i.e., it induces clonal anergy rather than clonal deletion).
score --> 0
However, daclizumab, a human monoclonal antibody directed against the in- terleukin-2 receptor, has several advantages over other induction agents.

Given its unique composition, its use is not functionally immunogenic.

19-21    Its effective se- rum half-life is 21 days   22   ; five doses thus provide sat- uration for at least 3 months (as determined by recep- tor-saturation studies   23   ), which covers the period of the highest incidence of cardiac-allograft rejection.
score --> 0
2   Moreover, this lack of immunogenicity makes possible prolonged courses and may permit repeated use of this agent for more than three months.
score --> 0
Furthermore, rejection that occurred after the cessation of daclizu- mab therapy was generally preceded by the develop- ment of circulating IgG anti-HLA antibodies.
score --> 0
Indeed, the one death due to acute rejection in the daclizumab group was preceded by both the formation of circulat- ing IgG antibodies and a positive result on the lym- phocyte-growth assay.

Therefore, careful immunologic screening may identify patients who require pro- longed, higher-dose, or repeated daclizumab therapy.

Interestingly, although the frequency of acute re- jection episodes was significantly reduced during da- clizumab therapy, the number of interleukin-2–acti- vated T cells present in the allograft, as measured by the lymphocyte-growth assay, did not differ signifi- cantly between the groups.

Daclizumab therapy also produced a marked re- duction in the formation of anti-HLA antibodies that was sustained, even after induction therapy was stopped.

The fact that daclizumab affects the production of anti-HLA antibodies suggests that the drug has a prominent ef- fect on the indirect pathway of recognition.

The admin- istration of daclizumab was not associated with any detectable signs of the cytokine release syndrome or allergic responses.

The incidence of infection or cancer was not higher in the daclizumab group than in the control group.

This finding may reflect the fact that more selective immunosuppression can be achieved or that the dose of prednisone can be tapered more rapidly with daclizumab therapy than with conven- tional immunosuppressive therapy.
score --> 0
It has advantages over conven- tional induction therapy with muromonab-CD3 or antithymocyte globulin because it is more selective and because it can be used for prolonged and poten- tially repeated periods.

Studies with larger cohorts are needed to address the short-term and long-term sur- vival benefits for patients and should determine the optimal dosing schedules with the possible repeated use of daclizumab.
