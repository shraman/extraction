A number of respon- dents commented on the ‘improved quality of patient care’ since the introduction of a CM.

Personnel also reported that feedback from patients had been posi- tive, because ...patients are pleased, and find it a great help...to be able to contact and speak with the person they have come to know and rely on with fol- low-up care, with just a phone call.

One respondent said that this professional approach to discharge care should be implemented on every ward, to lessen the anxiety of a patient and family on his/her discharge from the ward.

One commented, I have found it really helpful having (the CM) who has been very interested in particular patients and who we have been able to call (on)...

This may also reflect the fact that more intervention patients than controls were without a caregiver.

Although this difference was not statistically significant, it is evident from the qualitative data that the CM was seen by a number of patients as having a caring role.

In-depth interviews revealed considerable differ- ences between groups particularly in relation to the high value placed on case management by interven- tion group participants.

However, there is no reason to believe that these patients would differ from pa- tients who were enrolled, in ways relevant to this tory physician]s and nursing staff,’ and fulfilled the role of clinical resource person for personnel.

Little difference was found between the con- trol and intervention groups in terms of the key out- come variables: anxiety, depression, symptoms, sup- port and subjective well-being.
score --> 0
This was possibly due to the brief nature of the intervention.
score --> 0
A more intensive follow-up may overcome this problem as intensive case management has been found to enhance patient outcomes in stud- ies of mental health,26 particularly for patients who are frequently hospitalized.27 A longer time-frame for the follow-up may also have shown significant differ- ences.

Given the small sample size, it was not possi- ble to identify significant differences between the two strata comprising each group.
