Acta Orthopaedica 2015; 86 (3): 363–372 367 Overall, the repeated measurements of Modified Barthel  index score, compared to prefracture levels, on days 10, 30,  and 90 after surgery, were similar within transfusion groups,  i.e.
score --> 1
For  nursing home residents, the curves were parallel (p = 0.4) and  the means were equal (p = 0.3) between transfusion groups.

Likewise, for sheltered housing residents, the curves were par- allel (p = 0.6) and the means were equal (p = 0.9) between  transfusion groups (Figure 2).

Intention to treat: repeated measurements on recovery from physical disabilities before fracture  until postoperative days 10, 30 and 90, presented as median score with interquartile range, in residents from  nursing homes and sheltered housing facilities.

The main cause of death for both transfusion groups was  pneumonia (p = 0.11) (Table 4).

It  remains uncertain, however, whether the anemia was chronic  or was caused by the fracture.

Poor physical ability before fracture and  (chronic) anemia are 2 of many factors that affect functional  prognosis in nursing home residents (Onem et al.

Our results did not directly reproduce the findings that  higher Hb levels are associated with better early functional  recovery after hip fracture surgery.

Postoperative anemia in surgical hip fracture patients is  associated with delirium and nosocomial infections (Marcan- tonio et al.

In our study, we found no  difference in the number of infections during the intervention  period (unpublished data).

In contrast  to previous studies, this included patients who were unable  to walk independently, and we found that higher Hb levels  reduced 90-day mortality.

The difference between the Hb targets  of RBC transfusion strategies may not have been sufficient  to yield more significant results.
score --> 1
Furthermore, our national guidelines recommend a Hb  target as low as 9.7 g/dL in elderly hip fracture patients.
score --> 1
The large proportion of non-frail elderly patients admit- ted from sheltered housing facilities may have diluted our  intervention effects.
score --> 1
Thus, we needed  more patients than previously calculated in order to show a  distinct difference between the transfusion groups.
score --> 1
No frail elderly patients with Hb levels below 9.7 g/dL were  excluded during the first 6 days of recruitment, since trans- fusions made it possible for them to participate.
score --> 1
No selection bias intruded, since during the entire study  period daily assessments in the orthopedic ward continued  for every hip fracture patient admitted from nursing homes or  sheltered housing.

This could have distorted the results, although the RCT design  would have distributed such confounding equally across both  transfusion groups.

Acta Orthopaedica 2015; 86 (3): 363–372 365 Measurements The primary outcome was recovery from physical disabilities,  with 3 tools being used to measure physical performance: (1)  Modified Barthel index measured the basic self-care activi- ties of daily living (ADL) performance ranging from 0 to 100  points (100 = best), assessing 10 domains—eating, transfer- ring, personal care, toiletry, bathing, walking, managing stairs,  dressing, bowel control, and bladder control; (2) New Mobil- ity score ranging from 0 to 9 points (9 = best), assessing both  indoor and outdoor walking abilities, and ability to go shop- ping; and (3) cumulated ambulation score, with a daily score  from 0 to 6 points (6 = best), assessing getting in and out of  bed, sitting-to-standing-to-sitting, and walking ability with an  appropriate aid.
