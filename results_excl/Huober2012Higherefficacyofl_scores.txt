Even though these differences did not reach statistical significance, the results of the eLEcTRA trial compare rather well to the other two randomized trials with similar differences between the two treatment arms and similar reductions in the hazard ratio for PFS (hazard ratios for eLEcTRA, TAnDEM and EGF30008 0.67, 0.63, and 0.71 respectively).

It is certainly noteworthy that the median TTP (eLEcTRA) or PFS (TAnDEM, EGF30008) for the HER2 positive patients treated by endocrine treatment alonewas comparably low in all three trials with 3.3, 2.4, and 3.0 months, respectively.

The eLEcTRA trial was stopped prematurely since accrual was slow in this niche pop- ulation and after first presentation of the TAnDEM trial, accrual in eLEcTRA was not expected to improve.21 Unfortunately, in smaller trial populations, patient characteristics between the groups may differ slightly.

In the TAnDEM trial, patients with HER2 and HR positive MBC after tamoxifen failure were randomized to anastrozole or to anastrozole plus trastuzu- mab.15 In the second randomized phase 3 trial (EGF30008), HER2 and HR positive patients were randomized to letrozole or letrozole plus lapatinib.16 The eLEcTRA trial confirms and extends the results of these two trials (Table 5).

It was concluded that the growth promoting effects of the HER2 pathway can be inhibited by potent estrogen deprivation.24,25 In the eLEcTRA trial - as a second predefined comparison - the treatment effect of letrozole alonewas assessed in the HER2 positive and HR positive cohort compared to the HER2 negative and HR positive patients.

To ensure that there is no inadvertent bias regarding German and non German patients of arm A (since in cohort C only German patients were included), we looked at the response rates of these two cohorts of arm A which were quite similar though (CBR 36% vs. 40%).

In addi- tion, the results from eLEcTRA as well as two other randomized trials15,16 show that the strategy to combine two targeted approaches in this population is not only feasible and safe but is also effective resulting in increased tumor control and delayed tumor progression.
