Adherence to an appropriate regimen has repeat- edly been shown to improve exercise tolerance, increase strength and endurance, and reduce dyspnea in patients with COPD.1-10 However, benefits are known to be muscle-group–specific indicating the need for dif- ferential upper extremity training (UET) to promote the performance of activities of daily living (ADLs).11-14 Unsupported arm work has been shown to result in significant increases in metabolic and ventilatory demand.15-18 One approach to enhance exercise adher- ence involves the use of behavioral interventions such as distraction, in combination with exercise training.

Distractive auditory stimuli (DAS) occupy the attention channels that normally carry dyspneagenic informa- tion.19 Music can be effective as a distractive stimulus when used with exercise, leading to better tolerance of increasing levels of exercise and a reduced perception of dyspnea on exertion.19 While music used with exer- cise has been reported to be upbeat in tempo, the effect of differential music tempos has not been described.

DISCUSSION This study determined that subjects who used DAS (either moderate or slow tempo) during UET signifi- cantly improved functional performance as reflected in an increase in the numbers of rings moved during the 6MPRB test.

This study builds on the conceptual framework of Haas and col- leagues,19 who advocate the combination of exercise and distraction to reduce perception of dyspnea.

Total exercise time was 22% longer with music as the DAS compared with either the gray noise or silence (P  .001).
score --> 1
While this study provided strong support for the immediate efficacy of DAS in improving exercise capacity, longer term benefits were not examined.
score --> 1
While no significant differ- ences in 6-minute walk distance (P  .25), perceived dyspnea or ratings of perceived exertion (modified Borg scale) were noted, 60% of the subjects enjoyed lis- tening to music while exercising.
score --> 1
Longer term effects of DAS on lower extremity exer- cise continuation were tested by Bauldoff and col- leagues.21 In this study, 24 persons with moderate to severe COPD were randomized to either DAS (n  12) or control (n  12) used during an 8-week, home- based, independent walking program following com- pletion of formal pulmonary rehabilitation program.
score --> 1
By 4 weeks the DAS group had increased 177.5 ft, whereas the control group decreased 52.1 ft; by 8 weeks the DAS group had increased by 445.4 ft, whereas the control group had decreased by 169.1 ft. Because our current study involved only 4 weeks of training, we hypothesize that differences between control and DAS groups would have been greater even if a longer training program had been used.
score --> 1
There are several limitations to this study.

However, all groups noted in the logs when they did not exercise and the DAS groups verbally reported compliance.

Distractive Stimuli on UET / 55 CONCLUSIONS The major findings of this study were that subjects who used either moderate DAS or slow DAS, both in the form of music, while performing UET, improved their upper extremity functional performance as measured by the 6MPRB test while the controls remained the same.
