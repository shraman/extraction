Dyspnea is a distressing sensation that limits exercise tolerance, and, as such, some clinicians regard it as a primary outcome measure in the rehabilitation of patients with COPD.35–37 It has been suggested that a 1-unit change represents the minimum clinically important difference for dyspnea ratings using the modified Borg scale (Denis O’Donnell, MD; personal commu- nication; April 6, 2000).
score --> 3
This results in further deconditioning, wors- ening of symptoms, and reduced quality of life.1 Respi- ratory rehabilitation programs reverse this cycle by encouraging walking, which is an important, useful, and preferred form of exercise for many individuals with COPD.2,3 Wheeled walking aids are sometimes prescribed for patients with COPD to improve their functional exercise capacity.4 Wheeled walkers are walker frames with two, three, or four standard wheels.
score --> 2
Information on the influence of wheeled walking aids in patients with COPD has been limited to reports that used small sample sizes,4,10–14 subjects with mild disease,14 testing that predated the use of standardized, validated walking tests,10,11 and a study design that was confounded by subjects having to pull their portable oxygen during the unassisted walk.4 Therefore, this study was undertaken to de- termine the short-term effect of using a rollator on functional exercise capacity among individuals with COPD and to characterize which individuals with COPD would benefit most from its use.

We also evaluated the characteristics that are most likely to be associated with an improvement in functional exercise capacity among a homogeneous population of patients with severe disease.
score --> 2
The improvements observed among the more disabled subjects may be especially important as improvements in exercise performance and health status in patients with COPD after an exercise program may depend on the severity of their disabil- ity.

Wedzicha and colleagues38 noted that although patients with moderate disability (ie, Medical Re- search Council dyspnea grades 3 and 4) who were mobile outside of their homes showed improvements in exercise capacity following rehabilitation, those with severe disability (ie, Medical Research Council dyspnea grade 5) who were largely housebound showed no improvement in exercise performance following individualized physical training.

The Short-term Effect of a Rollator on Functional Exercise Capacity Among Individuals With Severe COPD* Sherra Solway, MSc, BSc (PT); Dina Brooks, PhD, MSc, BSc (PT); Louis Lau; and Roger Goldstein, MB, ChB, FCCP Study objectives: This study was conducted to examine the short-term effects of using a rollator on functional exercise capacity among individuals with COPD and to characterize which individuals benefit most from its use.
score --> 1
Results: Use of the rollator was associated with a significant reduction in dyspnea (p < 0.001) and duration of rest (reduction for the total group, 19 s; and reduction for those who walked < 300 m unaided, 40 s; p  0.001) during the 6MWT.

The requirement to rest during an unaided 6MWT was a significant predictor of improved functional exercise capacity with the use of the rollator (p < 0.005).

Subjects were considered eligible for the study if they had received a diagnosis of COPD,15 were clinically stable (ie, had no evidence of acute exacerbation and had experienced no change in medication or bronchodilator use in the previous 4 weeks), were between 55 and 85 years of age, and were unaccustomed to the use of a walking aid.

Measures Primary Measures: Functional exercise capacity was the pri- mary outcome of this study and was evaluated by 6MWT distance, duration of rest, and modified Borg ratings of dys- pnea.20,21 Distance walked was automatically recorded using a photosensing device (Photoelectric Switch; Omron Corporation; Tokyo, Japan), which was placed on the wheel of the tester’s cart.

Modified Borg Rating of Dyspnea: The rollator was associated with a statistically significant reduc- tion in dyspnea in the total sample (WR, 1.8 0.2 unit change; NR, 2.7 0.3 unit change; p 0.001).

Regression Analysis: Baseline measures of impair- ment (FEV1), disability (unaided 6MWT distance of  300 m or  300 m), and quality of life (SGRDQ scores), as well as other variables such as oxygen use, resting during the unassisted 6MWT, and baseline dyspnea ratings, were evaluated by simple regression analysis to identify potential predictors of improve- ment in functional exercise capacity with use of the rollator (Table 3).

The use of the rollator was not associated with changes in ventilation or breathing pattern, an ob- servation that is in agreement with that of Grant and Capel,11 who used a respirometer to measure minute ventilation in five men with COPD and noted no change when they walked with a wheeled walking aid.
score --> 1
Dyspnea is also influenced by emotion.47 During exercise, an individual may breathe hard and not experience the sensation of dyspnea because such exertion is not accompanied by a sense of anxiety over the adequacy of ventilation.48 Additionally, the sensation of dyspnea may occur without a corre- sponding change in ventilation or gas exchange.48 Therefore, patients with COPD who are anxious may experience more dyspnea for a given amount of work than those who are not.

Discussion We have extended the observations reported on the use of wheeled walking aids in patients with COPD4,10–13 to include a larger sample size, stan- dardized walking tests, and measures of weight transferred to the rollator.

Use of a rollator reduced dyspnea and rest time during walking among stable subjects with severe COPD.

For individuals who walked  300 m unaided, the distance walked also increased.

Functional capacity has been defined as the ability to undertake physically demanding activities of daily living.33 An improvement in functional capacity can be manifested by walking further or by being less breathless for the same distance walked.34 In this study, all of the subjects experienced a reduction in dyspnea with the rollator.
score --> 0
The use of a rollator resulted in a 1-unit reduction in the perception of dyspnea for the total sample and a 1.4-unit reduction for those patients who were most disabled.

Subjects with greater disability (ie, 6MWT dis- tance,  300 m) walked further WR.

Although a minimal change in 6MWT distance of 54 m has been suggested as the threshold for a clinically important improvement, this value is based on a COPD popu- lation with an average 6MWT distance of 371 m.30 Given that our subgroup walked 220 m during the unaided 6MWT, the smaller improvement of 22 m is likely to be meaningful, especially since it was ac- companied by a reduction in dyspnea.

Honeyman and colleagues4 and Wesmiller and Hoffman12 have reported comparable improvements with the use of a rollator among individuals with similar levels of disability.

The outcome of rest duration has received little attention in the literature.
score --> 0
We included a measure of rest duration as this information allows a clearer understanding of the walk test.39 Our finding of a reduction in rest time of 19 s for the total group and 40 s for the more disabled subgroup supports the benefit of using a rollator, especially when considered in conjunction with the reduction in dyspnea and the improvement in walking distance observed among the more dis- abled subjects.

Improvement in ventilation using the rollator may be contingent on being able to adopt the “forward-lean” position frequently seen among pa- tients with COPD.40 This position is thought to improve the effectiveness of the diaphragm, thereby reducing work of breathing.40,41 Whereas other stud- ies on wheeled walking aids have used high-wheeled walkers10,11,14 or have adjusted the height of the aid for comfort,12 we standardized the height of the rollator, using the approach that most clinicians adopt when prescribing walking frames.16,42 It is possible that the height of the rollator may have been too low to facilitate this forward-lean position.
score --> 0
Improvement with the rollator was not dependent on the actual amount of weight applied to the rollator, which was only 7% of the subject’s body weight.

Individuals with COPD often breathe with their accessory respiratory muscles including those of the upper arm and shoul- der girdle, which have roles both in the maintenance of ventilation and in postural stabilization.43,44 When the arms are unsupported, such as in arm swing during ambulation, the accessory muscles increase their participation in the postural support of the chest wall.
score --> 0
To reduce dyspnea, individuals often stabilize their arms.45 This stabilization enables the arm and shoulder girdle muscles to act more effec- tively as accessory muscles of respiration.46 There- fore, the rollator may have facilitated a reduction in dyspnea by enabling the users to stabilize their upper limbs during walking, thereby improving the effec- tiveness of their accessory muscles.43,44 In this study, we did not evaluate the electromyographic activity of accessory muscles.
score --> 0
Use of the rollator may have provided sufficient reassurance to reduce anxiety during walking to result in a reduction in their perception of dyspnea without a corresponding change in ventilation.
score --> 0
We may in fact have underes- timated the benefit of a rollator among individuals with severe COPD as, in the course of modifying the rollator to incorporate the measurement of upper extremity weight-bearing, we removed the seat.

Stride length and walking speed have been shown to be altered when using various types of wheeled walking aids, especially among older subjects with no underlying lung disease.6,49–51 Although neither changed in the current study, we did observe changes in minute-to-minute variability of distance walked, reflecting improved pacing, especially among subjects with greater disability (Fig 3).

Finally, we noted that the majority of subjects, especially individuals with greater disability, pre- ferred using the rollator to walking unaided.
