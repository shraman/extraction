Twenty-nine consecutive patients were divided into 3 groups: firstly, 7 intubated patients who received mechanical ventilation at study entry comprised the intubation group.
score --> 4
At study entry, an illness severity score was determined for each patient according to the APACHE (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) II system.10 Statistical Analysis Because all patients in the intubation group had cardio- genic shock and therefore their clinical condition was more severe than the other 2 groups, we have not done statistical analysis among the 3groups without baseline and patient characteristics.

The time from study entry to mechanical ventilation with endotracheal intubation averaged 37±23 h (8 patients) in the oxygen group and 23±18h (2 patients) in the CPAP group.

However, in patients with acute myocardial infarction-associated pulmonary edema that is not complicated by shock, nasal CPAP allows positive pressure ventilation without endotracheal intubation, improved oxygenation, and mortality rate.

The PaO2/FiO2 ratio increased in the intubation group (168±69 to 240±57, p<0.05) and the CPAP group (137±17 to 253±67, p<0.01) 24h after study entry.

One patient died within 24h and another within 48h after study entry in the intubation group.

A previ- ous study demonstrated that 51% of patients requiring mechanical ventilation following acute myocardial infarc- tion died.18 This is similar to the mortality rate (57%) for the intubation group in the present study.

The potential benefits of continuous positive airway pres- sure (CPAP) ventilation include an improvement in oxygenation, a decrease in respiratory work, and a decrease in left ventricular afterload.2–5 If CPAP using a mask is utilized in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema, the number of patients that later require mechanical ventilation by means of endotracheal intubation can be reduced, while oxygenation and respiratory rate are improved.6 Further, we have reported that nasal CPAP led to an early decrease in plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1) concentrations in patients with severe cardiogenic pulmonary edema.7 In practice, however, there are no generally accepted criteria for the initiation of mechanical ventilation in patients with pulmonary edema in the setting of acute myocardial infarction.

All of the patients in the intubation group had cardiogenic shock.

Responses to pharmacologic agents may be blunted in poorly oxygenated patients, and mechanical ventilation is often necessary to reduce the work of breath- ing.19 In patients receiving only supplemental oxygen, oxygenation may be improved and respiratory muscle fatigue relieved by intubation and mechanical ventilation.20 Therefore, the mortality rate in the oxygen group may have been reduced if mechanical ventilation with intubation or mask CPAP had been initiated earlier after the onset of pulmonary edema.
score --> 2
The hemodynamic responses to CPAP indicate relief from the circulatory stress mediated by sympathetic drive in the setting of cardiogenic pul- monary edema.21 Previous electrophysiologic studies have shown that short term application of nasal CPAP increases heart rate variability as well as the time and frequency domain indices of parasympathetic activity without influ- encing cardiac sympathetic tone.22 This increase may occur reflexively through stimulation of afferent pulmonary mechanoreceptors.
score --> 2
We presume that nasal CPAP is likely to have a benefi- cial effect, as we found significant differences in-hospital mortality rate between the 2 study groups, but this study was too small to assess mortality adequately.

A large study is needed to define more precisely which patients are likely to benefit from this treatment.

In contrast, patients who received mechanical ventilation with intubation in early stages of myocardial infarction had a high hospital mortal- ity rate.

Bersten et al previously reported that the proportion of patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema who required mechanical ventilation with intubation was higher if they were initially treated with supplemental oxygen therapy than if they were treated with mask CPAP.6 However, the in-hospital mortality rate did not differ between these 2 groups.

In contrast, in the present study, both the percent- age of patients requiring mechanical ventilation with intu- bation and the mortality rate were higher if cardiogenic pulmonary edema was treated with supplemental oxygen therapy alone.

In the acute phase of myocardial infarction, left ventricu- lar dysfunction can result from a combination of recent infarction, old scar, and viable but noncontracting ("stunned" or "hibernating") myocardium.11 Even in cases in which acute myocardial infarction reduces cardiac func- tion to a level that results in pulmonary edema, cardiac function may be improved chronically.
score --> 0
Specifically, func- tional recovery in areas of stunned  myocardium can occur under conditions in which ventilatory and circulatory status is improved.12 Conversely, nonsevere left ventricular dysfunction can further deteriorate in the setting of infarct extension.12 Thus improvement of oxygenation is essential for the recovery of contractile function.

Patients with acute heart failure have an increase in the amount of fluid in the alveoli, a reduction in lung volume and lung compliance, and an increase in airway resis- tance.13,14 Because of these changes, PEEP may improve oxygenation recruiting alveoli and redistributing fluid, thereby increasing end-expiratory lung volume.2,15 Myocardial function may also improve because of reduced left ventricular afterload resulting from increased intratho- racic pressure.3 It may be assumed that extravascular pulmonary fluid volume decreases more slowly and the alveolar ventilation-perfusion ratio remains lower in patients who receive only oxygen when compared to those who receive CPAP.

In patients receiving only supplemental oxygen, such a situation can result in increased respiratory work, placing greater demands on the heart.

Our results also suggest that the effects of drugs that improve circulation appear more slowly, or less completely, in patients receiving only supplemental oxygen than in patients in whom the oxygenation has been improved by CPAP.

Several investigators have suggested that one of the advantages of CPAP therapy is a reduction in respiratory work.16,17 Because we did not measure transpulmonary pressure changes or tidal volumes, we cannot demonstrate directly that respiratory work decreased during either treat- ment.

However, a decreased respiratory rate combined with subjectively less labored breathing in the CPAP group is indirect evidence of a decrease in the work of breathing.

In the same way, the high heart rate observed in the oxygen group is attributable, in part, to an increase in respiratory work due to tachypnea.

It is likely that the effects of CPAP on hemodynamics and oxygen delivery are greater in patients with acute myocardial infarction- associated pulmonary edema.

As one might expect from these char- acteristics, the hospital mortality in our population of patients was high (36%).

Respiratory distress and associated tachycardia are major threats to the ischemic myocardium in the setting of cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

Increased sympathetic activity leads to an excessive increase in both heart rate and systemic vascular resistance whereas cardiac contractility does not increase appropriately.

Tachycardia increases myocardial oxygen consumption, worsening local myocar- dial ischemia.

In addition, these responses to increased sympathetic tone are more marked in the acute stage of myocardial infarction.

High pulmonary artery pressures suggest that pulmonary congestion has not improved in the setting of cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

In addition, alveolar hypoventilation due to pulmonary edema can cause hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, which would elevate pulmonary artery 558 TAKEDA S et al.

In addition, hemodynamics improve earlier with CPAP.

Nasal CPAP therefore provides a safe and effective means of treating this condition.

Early and aggressive respiratory management is therefore recommended in patients with pulmonary edema associated with acute myocardial infarc- tion.
