Statistical Analysis   Since 32 percent of the patients assigned to receive medical therapy alone met the predefined criteria for treatment failure and were withdrawn from this study to undergo transmyocardial re- vascularization in a parallel, nonrandomized study, a modified ap- proach to the statistical analysis was required for certain end points.

In one study, transmyocardial revascularization with a carbon dioxide laser resulted in a higher per- ioperative mortality rate in patients with unstable angina than in those with stable angina (27 percent vs. 1 percent).
score --> 0
These results suggest that transmyocardial revascularization with a holmium laser should be performed, when possible, in patients with stable angina but that those with un- stable angina should not be denied this procedure.

The subjective nature of angina assessment introduces the possibility of bi- as.

Relief of angina for up to four years has been reported in pa- tients who underwent transmyocardial revasculariza- tion with a carbon dioxide laser.

The success of transmyocardial revascularization is thought to be due to improved regional blood flow to ischemic myocardium, but the precise mechanisms of its effects remain unclear.

Horvath and associates   9    reported a small improve- ment in perfusion after transmyocardial revascular- ization performed with a carbon dioxide laser.

However, the follow-up was incomplete, the analysis was not computer-quantified, and im- proved perfusion was poorly correlated with relief of angina.

Angiogenesis   22-24    and sympathetic denervation25-27 are plausible mechanisms for the clinical results achieved with transmyocardial revascularization.
score --> 0
The possibility that denervation may lead to silent ischemia or infarction after transmyo- cardial revascularization is less likely, since there was no increase in fixed perfusion defects in our trans- myocardial-revascularization group.
score --> 0
The mechanism of action of transmyocardial revascularization is prob- ably multifactorial, with angiogenesis and denerva- tion occurring concurrently.
