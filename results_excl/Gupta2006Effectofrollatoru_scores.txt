Eligible subjects were clinically stable with a diagnosis of mod- erate-to-severe COPD according to American Thoracic Society criteria12 (FEV1  59% predicted; FEV1/FVC  0.7), had com- pleted pulmonary rehabilitation in the last year, had not had previous rollator use, and had an unassisted 6MW distance 375 m. Subjects with associated medical conditions that limited exercise tolerance and those with an inability to communicate were excluded.

Results Sample Of 316 subjects screened, 241 were ineligible for a variety of reasons: 6MW  375 m (n  86); previous use of a rollator  4 weeks (n 58); comorbidities that influenced exercise tolerance (n 39); inability to walk unaided (n 17); unconfirmed diagnosis of severe COPD (n 22); clinical instability (n 5); unable to attend for follow-up measures (n 7); unable to communicate in English (n 5); noncom- pliant (n 2).
score --> 4
This lack of use almost certainly influenced the lack of between- group differences in exercise tolerance and quality of life.
score --> 2
However, provision of a rollator at home was not associated with group differences in the CRQ (p > 0.08) or in the unassisted 6MW (p  0.4) or the assisted 6MW (p  0.5).
score --> 1
Conclusions: Despite evidence of effectiveness during acute testing, this study did not demon- strate a rollator effect on quality of life or exercise capacity when the rollator was provided at home, for a longer period.

These improvements were accompanied by a patient preference for assisted walking, in addition to reducing dyspnea, and a greater sense of safety.10 Despite several reports on the short-term effects of rollators, little is known about their long-term effects.

For example, in Ontario, Canada, with a pop- ulation of approximately 10 million, nearly 5,000 rollators were funded from 2003 to 2004, for adults with a diagnosis of respiratory disease, at a cost of $1.5 million (Canadian dollars) [Ministry of Health; personal communication; May 2005].

Outcomes were not measured  1 week after the study period, in order to minimize the so called “late comer” bias that is introduced when the measurement of outcomes is postponed until the patient’s condition has improved or deteriorated to the point of the outcome being systematically different from patients who were assessed on due time.17 Data Analysis The sample size was calculated from a clinically meaningful change in the CRQ score in which a sample size of 16 would be required for each group for a difference of 1.0, a two-tailed type I error of 0.05, and a type II error of 90%).13 A difference of 1.0 in each domain would allow for a moderate treatment effect to be evaluated.15 A repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to deter- mine if there was an effect of group or time.

score --> 0
However, the study does raise some impor- tant clinical and practical issues related to rollator provision.
score --> 0
Despite the fact that patients consistently walked further with a rollator when tested at three time points,18 and despite the majority of patients allocated to the rollator group indicating their pref- erence for walking with a rollator, 8 of 18 subjects used it less than three times a week.
score --> 0
This is supported by the post hoc analysis that showed the improvements in mastery for those who did use the rollator regularly.
score --> 0
The between-group differences at 4 weeks and at 8 weeks represent a small but clinically important change, beyond the minimal clinically important difference of 0.5 for that measure.19 Un- fortunately, we did not include a detailed assessment of why the rollator was used and only listed the primary activities for which it was used.
score --> 0
Therefore, we cannot comment on the seasonal impact of either hot or inclement whether.
score --> 0
Nor did we collect infor- mation on whether infrequent users regarded the rollator as a social stigma.
score --> 0
Although the CRQ is an excellent, disease-specific questionnaire frequently used in studies of individ- uals with COPD, the dyspnea domain requires that patients identify five important daily activities lim- ited by dyspnea.14 Given that a rollator impacts only on ambulation, if this was not of sufficient impor- tance to be listed, then the effects of the rollator on walking would not be relevant to the patient’s assess- ment of their dyspnea.
score --> 0
Of note, 34% of subjects did not include ambulatory activities among the items self selected for the dyspnea domain.
score --> 0
More than half of the subjects listed bathing or stair climbing, and one third listed dressing, bending, carrying, or being upset.
score --> 0
Notwithstanding the above, the absence of between-group differences in the other domains of the CRQ, such as mastery or fatigue, makes it unlikely that the dyspnea domain misrepresented the influence of the rollator on quality of life.
score --> 0
An obvious design weakness is that we did not require the patients to record, nor did we provide an indepen- dent assessment of the amount of time for which the rollator was used.
score --> 0
Patients were only required to note the days on which they used the equipment.
score --> 0
Ambulatory sup- port with a rollator is not designed to enable the patient to cover as much ground as possible, more to improve quality of life by increasing their overall endurance.
score --> 0
Therefore, although we used the 6MW as an entry criterion to establish who might benefit from assistance, we chose health-related quality of life as the primary outcome measure.
score --> 0
We may have biased the study against a more satisfactory result by enrolling only rollator-naive subjects.
score --> 0
In such circumstances, patients who regu- larly used a rollator when assigned to the control group would have demonstrated less favorable out- comes than those assigned to the rollator group.

However, this design would have required the re- moval of rollators from those who clearly benefited from them.

This has important resource implications.
score --> 0
For example, in the province of On- tario, Canada (population 12.5 million), the assistive devices program funds 75% of the cost of a rollator at a price range of $400 to $500 (Canadian), thereby allocating $1.5 million annually in support of the 5,000 rollators provided to patients with a respiratory diagnosis.

Therefore, whether and how a patient with COPD benefits from a rollator is important.

Guidelines state that the equipment must be re- quired for mobility within the individual’s place of residence, or to gain entry into and exit from it.

Cost savings could result from education of patients and health-care providers as to the indications, applica- tion, and expected benefits from using a rollator, and further savings might accrue from the recycling of equipment.
score --> 0
In fact, outdoor walking, and indoor walking outside of the home were the most fre- quently identified primary activities for which the patients used their rollator.
score --> 0
In summary, although this report extends the observation period beyond the short-term studies previously reported, further evaluations of rollator effectiveness, that include objective monitoring of usage,20 are required to establish longer term bene- fits.

Provision of a rollator, even among severely impaired COPD patients who walked further during acute testing and who stated a preference for its use, is not synonymous with frequent use or with benefit.

The improved mastery scores among regular users suggest that health-care providers should evaluate frequency of use and impact for those provided with this ambulatory aid.
