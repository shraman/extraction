IMMUNOSUPPRESSIONsults: Eighty patients were randomized and analyzed. By Month 6, the incidence of the composite safety
end-point was significantly lower with basiliximab than with ATG (50.0% vs 78.6%, p  0.01), and
infectious death was less frequent in the basiliximab group (0 of 38 vs 6 of 42, p  0.027). The
composite efficacy end-point occurred in 24 patients (63.2%) in the basiliximab arm vs 28 patients
(66.7%, p  not significant [NS]) receiving ATG. Acute rejection episodes of Grade 1B were
reported with similar frequency (50% with basiliximab vs 45.2% with ATG, p  NS); 7 patients
(18.4%) in the basiliximab group and 3 (7.1%) in the ATG group had rejection Grade 3A.
nclusions: These results suggest that basiliximab offers improved tolerability with similar efficacy compared with current
polyclonal antibody induction therapy in de novo heart transplant patients. J Heart Lung Transplant 2007;26:

nventional induction therapy, including anti-thy-
cyte globulin (ATG) and OKT3, has been used for
0 years in heart transplantation as prophylaxis
ainst early rejection.1 Although polyclonal anti-
phocyte induction has proven effective in de-
asing the incidence of cardiac allograft rejection,
it has the disadvantage of being associated with a
high risk of infection, especially viral infections such
as cytomegalovirus (CMV),2– 4 and lymphoprolifera-
tive disorders.5,6 Moreover, ATG use is associated
with a significant level of adverse events due to
T-lymphocyte depletion.

July 2007In contrast, monoclonal antibodies specific to the
erleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor result in selective immuno-
ppression by targeting activated T-cell proliferation in
ponse to allograft antigens, such that T-cell prolifer-
on is blocked but resting T-lymphocytes are not
pleted.7 Thus, the broad cross-reactivity seen with
re traditional induction therapy agents such as ATG
avoided. However, the use of anti-CD25 therapy has
ly recently been assessed in heart transplantation in
domized, multicenter studies.8–10 Results from a
ot study have suggested that addition of the chimeric
2 receptor antibody basiliximab to a conventional
ple-therapy regimen is safe and well-tolerated,9 and
n delay initiation of cyclosporine without increased
k of rejection in patients at risk of renal dysfunc-
n.8,10 Comparative studies of IL-2 receptor antibody
uction vs ATG in thoracic transplantation to date,
wever, have been single-center retrospective analy-
. Two such studies have demonstrated an efficacy
vantage for ATG after heart11 and lung12 transplanta-
n. In renal transplantation, in contrast, three prospec-
e trials of basiliximab vs ATG have shown compara-
rejection rates, but better tolerability, as well as
er levels of CMV infection with basiliximab.13–15
The current open, multicenter, comparative, random-
d study was designed to assess the safety of basilix-
ab and ATG in de novo heart transplant recipients
eiving cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)
d steroids. In contrast to renal transplantation, cyclo-
orine initiation is not generally delayed in ATG-
ated patients in France, and thus concomitant immu-
suppression was identical in both treatment arms.

tients between the ages of 18 and 65 years undergo-
a primary heart transplant with a cold ischemia time
6 hours were eligible for inclusion. Key exclusion
teria were: receipt of a graft from a donor aged 60

nsplant, or ATG (Thymoglobuline, IMTIX-SangStat,
on, France) administered as a continuous infusion of
mg/10 kg per day from Day 0 to Days 3 to 5
st-transplant. All patients also received cyclosporine,
rticosteroids and MMF. Cyclosporine was adminis-
ed either as a continuous infusion of 1 to 3 mg/kg/
y or orally 4 to 6 mg/kg/day (Neoral, Novartis, Basel,
itzerland) to maintain trough levels of 150 to 350
/ml during Weeks 1 to 6 and 150 to 300 ng/ml during
eek 6 to Month 6. Intravenous steroids were pre-
ibed according to local practice. Oral prednisone
s initiated at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day and tapered to
to 0.5 mg/kg/day by Day 21, with the dose no less
n 0.1 mg/kg/day by Month 6. MMF was initiated
ravenously and then orally (2 to 3 g/day), before
nsplantation or on the day of transplantation and
ntinued throughout the study period as per local
actice.
In all cases in which the donor was positive and the
ipient negative for CMV (D/R), patients received
onth prophylactic treatment with ganciclovir or
laciclovir. In all other cases, pre-emptive or therapeu-
treatment of CMV disease was applied as per local
actice. Patients received statin therapy irrespective of
ir initial cholesterol levels.
dy End-points
e primary safety end-point was the 6-month inci-
nce of a composite end-point consisting of the first of
y one of the following adverse events suspected by
investigator to be related to the study drug: serum
kness (fever [temperature 38°C] for 5 days, with
hralgia/myalgia); cutaneous rash; anaphylaxis;
ated infection; post-transplant lymphoproliferative
ease; or episodes of fever, thrombocytopenia and
kopenia. A non-inferiority analysis compared efficacy
tween treatment groups at Month 6, using a compos-
failure criterion (death, graft loss, acute rejection of
ade 1B [as per International Society for Heart and
ng Transplantation guidelines], acute rejection asso-
ted with hemodynamic compromise, acute rejection
ated with antibody therapy, or loss to follow-up,
ichever occurred first).

tistical Methods
oosing a power of 80% and a 2-sided significance
eshold led to a necessary sample size of 33 patients
each treatment group for detection of the primary
ety end-point, based on the assumption that the
d-point would occur in 50% of patients in the ATG
up and 15% in the basiliximab group. Allowing for
op-outs, a sample size of 40 patients per group was
nsidered necessary.
The safety population comprised all randomized pa-
nts who received at least one dose of study medica-
n and had at least one subsequent assessment of
ety/tolerability. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population
mprised randomized patients who received at least
e dose of study medication and had at least one
bsequent efficacy assessment. A per-protocol analysis
s conducted in the population of patients available
the ITT analysis who had no major deviations to the
otocol.
Baseline patient characteristics and demographic
ta were compared using Wilcoxon’s rank tests or
her’s exact tests, as appropriate. Fisher’s exact tests
re used to compare the incidence of adverse events
spected to be related to the study drug by the
estigator (primary safety end-point). Efficacy analy-
were designed to show non-inferiority of basilix-
ab vs ATG. Survival distributions for efficacy end-
int were estimated using Kaplan–Meier curves and

tients were lost to follow-up, and none of the com-
nents of the composite efficacy end-point differed
nificantly between the two groups. By Month 6, 19
tients in each group had undergone BPAR Grade1B
each group (50.0% and 45.2%, respectively). Recur-
t BPAR (Grade 1B) was reported in 6 patients in
basiliximab group (5 patients had two episodes and
atient had three episodes) and 3 patients in the ATG
up had two episodes each. Sixteen patients (42.1%)
the basiliximab group and 15 patients (35.7%) in the
G group had a treated acute rejection episode
rade 1B). Seven patients (18.4%) in the basiliximab
up and 3 patients (7.1%) in the ATG group had an
isode of BPAR Grade 3A (p  0.088, Fisher’s test).
an time to first BPAR of Grade 1B was 47.9  43.8
ys in the basiliximab group and 66.5  37.2 days in
ATG group. During Months 6 to 12, one further
ute rejection of Grade 1B was reported in each
up; thus, the composite efficacy end-point occurred
25 patients (65.8%) in the basiliximab group and 28
tients (66.7%) in the ATG group by Month 12 (p 

mposite efficacy end-point (Figure 2).

r results show that basiliximab induction is better
erated than ATG in de novo heart transplant recipi-
ts, with no apparent compromise in efficacy when
ministered in combination with cyclosporine, corti-
steroids and MMF. The incidence of the primary
mposite safety end-point was lower with basiliximab,
ifference largely accounted for by a reduced inci-
nce of hematologic events. The incidence of adverse

The number of patients in our study who pre-
nted with at least one infection tended to be lower
the basiliximab group than in the ATG group, and
e rate of CMV infection was almost half that
served in the ATG group. Although not statistically
nificant, this difference is consistent with previous
ta showing no increase in infections with basilix-
ab induction9 and an increased risk of infection,
pecially CMV, with ATG.2,3 The difference in infec-
n rates is in line with the impact of the two agents

red with ATG. With infection being one of the
st common causes of early and late death in heart
nsplant recipients, the rate of septic death in our
pulation is of particular interest. Infection was
nd to be significantly lower with basiliximab than
th ATG, a finding that merits further evaluation in
arger population of patients. The 6 deaths due to
ection in the ATG cohort accounted for the higher-
an-expected mortality rate at 12 months (21%).
rtality in the basiliximab group was broadly in line

ipients.16,17
Much concern has been raised by a placebo-con-
lled study reporting an increased risk of death in
art transplant recipients treated with the anti-CD25
noclonal antibody daclizumab.18 In that study,
nducted in 434 heart transplant recipients, 21
tients (9.7%) in the daclizumab group and 11
tients (5.3%) in the placebo group died by Month
. Eight (38%) of the 21 patients who died in the
clizumab group had also received cytolytic therapy
uromonab-CD3 and anti-thymocyte or anti-lympho-
te agents). Among them, 6 (75%) died from infec-

Thus, in the daclizumab group, because of the dou-

Volume 26, Number 7eated with up to five different drugs—standard
ple-drug therapy, daclizumab and cytolytic drug
erapy), which may have resulted in the higher rate
septic death than in the placebo group.18 In line
th this hypothesis, the number of deaths in pa-
nts without cytolytic therapy was identical in both
atment groups (8 patients in each group). In our
en-label study, there were no deaths by infection
the basiliximab group during a 12-month follow-up
riod, and no cytolytic therapy was prescribed. This
ult, in apparent contrast to the high rate of septic
ath reported in the daclizumab group from the
uble-blind study, supports the hypothesis of an
intended level of immunosuppression in this treat-
nt arm.
Basiliximab demonstrated an efficacy similar to ATG.
e combined incidence of death, graft loss and acute
ection was similar in both groups and the incidence
BPAR Grade 1B and of acute rejection with
modynamic compromise was also similar, although
merically more patients had BPAR Grade 3A with
siliximab. Approximately one third of first rejec-
n episodes in the basiliximab cohort occurred at 2
3 months post-transplant. CD25 inhibition is max-
al with basiliximab induction for between 30 and
days,19 which underscores the need to ensure
equate maintenance immunosuppression during
e time when the effect of IL-2RA induction is
clining.
Our results suggest that basiliximab induction pro-
es improved tolerability in de novo heart transplant
ipients when compared with current polyclonal
tibody induction therapy, with no apparent loss of
cacy.
