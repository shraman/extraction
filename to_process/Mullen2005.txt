Background
Cardiac transplantation remains a definitive treatment
option for patients with end-stage heart disease. Survival
rates have improved dramatically. Nonetheless, progress
in immunosuppression has been slower, partly because
the heart is a fundamental organ and acute allograft rejec-
tion can include hemodynamic compromise, irreversible
graft injury, and death. Furthermore, the immunosuppres-
sive therapy used to prevent rejection increases the risk of
infection, which continues to be a leading cause of death
from allograft rejection; they are administered during
the immediate postoperative period when the risk of
rejection is highest due to a high donor leukocyte load
[3]. Data from the International Society of Heart and
Lung Transplant (ISHLT) show that 47% of adult heart
transplant patients in the first 6 months of 2012
received some type of induction therapy [1]. Either a
polyclonal anti-lymphocyte/anti-thymocyte globulin or
an interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor antagonist was utilized
in most protocols; however, the type of product used,
its dosage, and the duration of administration variedversus anti-thymocyte glo

http://www.transplantationresearch.com/content/3/1/14immune system. DZM was approved by Health Canada
and the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for prophy-
lactic use of acute organ rejection in patients receiving
renal transplants. Our induction therapy included T-
lymphocyte inactivation through the administration of
polyclonal anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG). There have
been no reported randomized controlled trials comparing
DZM to ATG induction in heart transplantation. The pur-
pose of this study was to compare these therapies in heart
transplant recipients.
Methods
All adults listed for heart transplantation between June
2001 and April 2005 were considered for the study.
Exclusion criteria included emergent surgery, previous
transplant, multiple-organ transplant including heart-
lung transplant, active infection, hepatitis C, high posi-
tive panel reactive antibodies (>15%), known sensitivity
to DZM, ATG, or mouse antigens, expected inability to
be followed at the study center for a full year, and in-
ability to give informed consent. Ethical approval was
obtained from the University of Alberta Health Research
Ethics Board.
A total of 30 adult heart transplant recipients were
randomized to receive either DZM (Hoffman-La Roche
Ltd., ON, Canada) or ATG (Pharmacia & Upjohn Inc.,
ON, Canada) as part of induction therapy. Randomization
was generated by computer. Enrolment and assessment
of outcomes were performed by two research assistants.
Only patients were blinded to the treatment. The primary
endpoints of this study were the number and severity of
infection episodes post-transplant. Secondary endpoints
included incidence of rejection, survival, and cost.
Immunosuppressive regimen
Patients in the control group received 10 mg/kg intra-
venous (IV) ATG beginning postoperatively and infused
continuously for 5 to 7 days until cyclosporine or tacro-
limus reached therapeutic levels. Patients in the treat-
ment group received DZM IV at 2 mg/kg within 4 h
postoperatively followed by a single 1 mg/kg dose on
postoperative day 4. Patients in both groups received
methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol®, Novopharm, ON,
Canada) 1 g IV intraoperatively, followed postoperatively
by 2 mg/kg IV every 12 h for three doses. This was
followed by prednisone or methylprednisolone (depending
on whether the patient could tolerate oral medication)
1 mg/kg daily. This was tapered by 2 mg/day to 0.3
mg/kg/day. Mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept®, Hoffman
La-Roche, ON, Canada) was given preoperatively 1,000
mg per oral or IV followed by 1,000 mg IV twice daily
postoperatively until the patient could tolerate oral medi-
cation. At this time the patient was switched to mycophe-
nolate mofetil 1,000 mg per oral twice daily, with a targetdose of 3 g daily. Patients treated with cyclosporine re-
ceived cyclosporin A (Neoral®, Novartis Pharmaceuticals
Canada Inc., QB, Canada) 150 mg to 300 mg per oral
twice daily until therapeutic levels were reached (250 μg/L
to 400 μg/L). Patients treated with tacrolimus (Prograf®,
Astellas Pharma Canada, Inc., ON, Canada) received ta-
crolimus 2 mg to 5 mg per oral twice daily until thera-
peutic levels were reached (10 mg/mL to 15 mg/mL).
Patients in the ATG group received a pulse of methylpred-
nisolone 2 mg/kg IV every 12 h for three doses starting at
the point of ATG discontinuation.
Infection prophylaxis
Patients with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus
(CMV) donor-seropositive/recipient-seronegative received
900 mg each day for 14 weeks of oral ganciclovir
(Cytovene®, Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., ON, Canada) or
valgancyclovir (Valcyte®, Hoffman-La Roche Ltd, ON,
Canada) therapy. Patients who were CMV donor sero-
positive/recipient seropositive or donor seronegative/
recipient seropositive received 2 weeks of 900 mg twice
per day of oral ganciclovir or valganciclovir therapy.
Diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic rejection
Acute rejection was defined as either biopsy-proven as
defined by ISHLT grade 3R (3A or 3B) or higher hist-
ology [5], suspected and subsequently treated rejection
in the presence of hemodynamic compromise, or grade
1A or 1B with symptoms (reduced ejection fraction,
shortness of breath, decreased voltages or a gallop rhythm).
Treatment of acute rejection typically consisted of intraven-
ous methylprednisolone 500 g to 1,000 g for 3 days. Severe
high grade or humoral rejection was treated with plasma-
phoresis, intravenous immune globulin, ATG, or RAT-
GAM (ATG made from rabbits). Grade 2 rejection or
symptomatic low grade (1A or 1B) rejection was treated
with a 50 mg to 80 mg prednisone tapering dose. Heart
transplant patients at our centre receive 13 biopsies during
the first year post transplant.
Diagnosis of infection
Infection was considered significant if it resulted in
symptoms and/or a change in medical management. An
infection was also considered to be severe if it appeared
to prolong hospitalization, required re-admission to hos-
pital, or was treated with intravenous antibiotics after
initial hospitalization.
Cost analysis
Cost data were determined by calculating total drug
cost, ICU cost, and ward cost. Drug costs were obtained
directly from the pharmacy department. ICU and ward
costs were based on a study by Hamilton et al. [6],
in which hospital costs were acquired from patient
resource consumption profiles. This accounting method
was developed at our center. It included nursing costs,
the direct and indirect labor and supply costs related to
nursing, laboratory, radiological, and rehabilitative medi-
cine costs, and all direct and indirect labor and supply
costs required to perform tests or procedures. Physician
fees were not included.
Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All analysis was based
upon an intention to treat principle. Continuous vari-
ables were compared between groups by an independent
t-test or Mann-Whitney U where non-parametric ana-
lysis was appropriate. Discrete variables were compared
between groups using chi-squared and Fisher’s exact
tests where appropriate. Survival curves were created
with the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank compari-
sons between groups. Results of continuous variables are
presented as mean ± standard error. The alpha level was
set at P ≤0.05. A study by Sarris et al. [7] revealed a 73%
1-year infection rate in heart transplant recipients. A
sample size of 14 patients per group was determined to
detect a 43% reduction in infection rate with an alpha
error of 5% and a power of 80%.
Results
The flow of participants through the study is presented
in Figure 1. One hundred and ninety-nine patients were
assessed for eligibility: 130 were deemed ineligible due
to exclusion criteria, seven declined, 32 did not partici-
pate because they did not receive a transplant during the
study period, and the remaining 30 were randomized.
There were no drop-outs.
A summary of recipient demographics and periopera-
tive outcomes are presented in Table 1. There were no
significant differences in preoperative recipient demo-
graphics. The incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) mismatch was similar between
groups. Patients in the DZM group tended to require
more inotropic support postoperatively (higher inotropic
severity score: DZM 65 ± 5, ATG 49 ± 6, P = 0.07). No
other statistically significant differences were observed in
intraoperative and immediate postoperative outcomes.

addition, average chloride was higher in the DZM
group (103 ± 1 mmol/L vs. 101 ± 1 mmol/L, P = 0.05). In
the control group, ATG was infused for 7 ± 2 days. As
expected, volume of ATG given intravenously was signifi-
cantly higher than DZM (5,934 ± 669 mL vs. 942 ± 152
mL, P <0.0001), and methylprednisolone dose was signifi-
cantly less in the DZM group (495 ± 38 mg vs. 1,242 ±
278 mg, P <0.0001). Other drug dosages and volumes
were similar between groups.
The cost analysis is illustrated in Figure 2. Induction
cost (cost of DZM vs. cost of ATG) was significantly
lower in the DZM group (Figure 2, $5,337 ± 308, CI ±
604.17 vs. $7,384 ± 799, CI ± 1,565.84, P = 0.03). Total
drug cost (induction cost plus methylprednisolone, myco-
phenalate mofetil, cyclosporine A and/or tacrolimus, and
prednisone) was also significantly lower in the DZM
group (Figure 2, $6,044 ± 328, CI ± 642.28 vs. $8,133 ±
828, CI ± 1,622.97, P = 0.03). In addition, hospital ward
(step-down unit) cost was lower in the DZM group
(Figure 2, $11,353 ± 3,320, CI ± 6,507.38 vs. $14,376 ±
3,526, CI ± 6,911.53, P <0.05). Intensive care unit stay
and total hospital costs were not significantly different
between groups (Figure 2).
The incidence of rejection is presented in Table 4.
Mean biopsy grade was lower in the DZM group, but
not statistically different (0.3 vs. 0.4, P = 0.09). Allograft
rejection occurred in two patients, both in the ATG
group. One of these patients had confirmed humoral re-
jection 19 days post transplant, and was treated with IV
immune globulin. The second patient experienced an
episode of hypotension 6 days post transplant with right
ventricular dysfunction and right bundle branch block
with decreased voltages. This was felt to be due to acute
rejection, and the patient was subsequently treated with
pentaspan, inotropes, IV cyclosporine A, and pulse steroids.
The number of patients experiencing at least one epi-
sode of infection was the same between groups (Table 4,
67% in both groups). Time to first infection and other
infectious complications were also similar between the
two groups.
No patient had any acute side effect or allergic reac-
tion to either study drug. There was no significant differ-
ence for incidence of steroid induced-diabetes. None
of the study patients were re-transplanted. One of the
patients in the DZM group had an incidence of malig-
nancy: a basal cell carcinoma lesion on the ear which
was treated successfully.
An actuarial survival curve is presented in Figure 3.
Survival at 1 month and 1 year was 100% and 87% in
the DZM group, and 93% and 87% in the ATG group,
respectively. There were two patients who died in the
ATG group. The first patient in the ATG group died 5

Discussion
Infection and rejection have been identified as risk factors
for morbidity and mortality after heart transplantation [1].
In order to improve patient survival and quality of life,
strategies have been developed to minimize these risk fac-
tors for infection and rejection, including induction agents
as part of the immunosuppression regimen in the early
postoperative period. This study compared the results of
using DZM versus ATG during induction therapy after
heart transplantation.

[37,38]. There have been few studies involving DZM in
cardiac transplantation [39-45], despite the observation

*has not been found to alter infection rates in kidney
[9,12,15,21,23,46], kidney-pancreas [28-30], heart [42,45],
lung [37,38,47,48] or liver [31,34,35,49,50] transplant
recipients.
The results of this study support the efficacy of a two dose
DZM regimen which is simpler in that patients need not
return to hospital for treatment every 2 weeks. The ATG
regimen is more complex than our DZM regimen, requiring
5 to 7 days of continuous intravenous infusion and more
steroid administration. In addition, ATG may have limited
use due to the formation of antibodies; therefore, treatment
of future rejection episodes may not be possible with ATG.
In this study, both average absolute lymphocyte count
and platelet count were significantly reduced in the ATG
group compared to the DZM group (Table 3). This finding
is consistent with our previous study of the two agents in
lung transplant recipients [37]. Brock and colleagues [38]
noted that in lung transplantation, patients receiving ATG
induction most commonly develop thrombocytopenia,
with 74% developing a platelet count of <100,000/mm3
[38]. In our current study, one patient in the ATG group
developed severe thrombocytopenia, however, not in
response to the ATG infusion.
The exact mechanism of effect of DZM is unknown;
however, the efficacy of DZM is likely related to its se-
lective targeting of active T-lymphocytes. DZM readily
Mullen et al. Transplantation Research 2014, 3:14 Page 7 of 9

lating active T-lymphocytes, preventing activation of in-
active T-lymphocytes by stimulation of the IL-2 receptor
and possibly causing down regulation of IL-2 receptor

get the active lymphocytes, leaving the immune system
otherwise intact. This is consistent with our results of
higher average absolute lymphocytes in the DZM group.
DZM has also been genetically engineered to contain
90% human determinants. This reduces the immunogen-
icity of the molecule and lengthens its circulating half-
life (20 days). An advantage of DZM’s long half-life is
that T-cell rebound after discontinuation of DZM does
not occur. Patients receiving ATG at our center receive
a pulse of methylprednisolone at the point of ATG dis-
continuation to prevent this T-cell rebound. Patients in
the ATG group therefore required a significantly higher
dose of methylprednisolone compared to the DZM
group. Furthermore, because only a fraction of the anti-
bodies from ATG are directed against T-lymphocytes, a
large amount of volume (10 mg/kg for 5 to 7 days) must
be administered. This extra volume may lead to excess
fluid balances which we normally try to avoid after heart
transplantation.
A cost analysis revealed that the cost of DZM induc-
tion was significantly lower than ATG induction in heart
transplant recipients. Total drug cost and hospital ward
cost was also less in the DZM group. The use of DZM
induction could thus lead to a cost savings of between
$2,000 and $3,000 in some heart transplant recipients.Our study has demonstrated that DZM was a safe
component of induction therapy in heart transplant-
ation. Our study highlights the advantages of DZM,
including ease of administration, lower cost, higher
lymphocyte count, and freedom from excessive platelet
destruction. Both methods of induction therapy worked
well with excellent 1-year survival. Daclizumab was
a useful induction agent in our immunosuppression
protocol for heart transplant recipients.
