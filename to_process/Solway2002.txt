Study objectives: This study was conducted to examine the short-term effects of using a rollator
on functional exercise capacity among individuals with COPD and to characterize which
individuals benefit most from its use.
Design: Repeated-measures randomized crossover design using the 6-min walk test (6MWT) as
the primary outcome measure.
Setting: Respiratory rehabilitation center.
Patients: Forty stable subjects who had received a diagnosis of COPD.
Interventions: Two 6MWTs were performed on each study day. One 6MWT was performed
unaided, and the other was performed with a rollator. The order was randomized on the first day
and reversed on the second day.
Results: Use of the rollator was associated with a significant reduction in dyspnea (p < 0.001) and
duration of rest (reduction for the total group, 19 s; and reduction for those who walked < 300 m
unaided, 40 s; p  0.001) during the 6MWT. For subjects who walked < 300 m unaided, there was
also a significant improvement in distance walked (p  0.02). No changes were found for the
measures of cardiorespiratory function or gait (p > 0.05). The requirement to rest during an
unaided 6MWT was a significant predictor of improved functional exercise capacity with the use
of the rollator (p < 0.005). The majority of subjects whose unaided 6MWT distance was < 300 m
preferred using the rollator to walking unaided.
Conclusions: Use of a rollator was effective in improving functional exercise capacity by reducing
dyspnea and rest duration among stable individuals with severe COPD. Individuals who walked
< 300 m and individuals who required a rest during an unaided 6MWT benefited the most from
using a rollator in terms of reduced dyspnea, reduced rest time, and improved distance walked.

I ndividuals with COPD experience reduced func-tional exercise capacity as their condition progresses.
In patients with severe disease, dyspnea may become
so disabling that they are obliged to adopt a sedentary
lifestyle. This results in further deconditioning, wors-
ening of symptoms, and reduced quality of life.1 Respi-
ratory rehabilitation programs reverse this cycle by
encouraging walking, which is an important, useful, and
preferred form of exercise for many individuals with
COPD.2,3
Wheeled walking aids are sometimes prescribed
for patients with COPD to improve their functional
exercise capacity.4 Wheeled walkers are walker
frames with two, three, or four standard wheels.
While a rollator is also considered a walker with four
wheels, the front two wheels typically are on swivel
casters for easy maneuverability.5 Rollators also are
equipped with hand brakes, a basket for carrying

objects, and a fold-down seat that allows the user to
rest at any time. Although wheeled walkers offer
important advantages over standard walkers (ie,
those without wheels),6–9 the effect of wheeled
walkers on functional capacity and activities of daily
living has not been studied extensively.
Information on the influence of wheeled walking
aids in patients with COPD has been limited to
reports that used small sample sizes,4,10–14 subjects
with mild disease,14 testing that predated the use of
standardized, validated walking tests,10,11 and a study
design that was confounded by subjects having to
pull their portable oxygen during the unassisted
walk.4 Therefore, this study was undertaken to de-
termine the short-term effect of using a rollator on
functional exercise capacity among individuals with
COPD and to characterize which individuals with
COPD would benefit most from its use.
Materials and Methods
Subjects
We recruited subjects who were enrolled in the respiratory
rehabilitation program at West Park Healthcare Center (Toronto,
ON, Canada). Subjects were considered eligible for the study if
they had received a diagnosis of COPD,15 were clinically stable
(ie, had no evidence of acute exacerbation and had experienced
no change in medication or bronchodilator use in the previous 4
weeks), were between 55 and 85 years of age, and were
unaccustomed to the use of a walking aid. Exclusion criteria
included the presence of associated medical conditions that
limited exercise tolerance (eg, symptomatic cardiovascular or
musculoskeletal conditions and recent surgery) or an inability to
communicate in English.
Protocol
The study was approved by the Human Subjects Review
Committee (University of Toronto). All subjects gave informed
written consent. A randomized crossover design was used with
the 6-min walk test (6MWT) as the primary outcome measure.
Each subject was studied at the same time of the day on two
separate days in the same week. Subjects did not perform the
exercise-training component of their respiratory rehabilitation
program on study days and were requested to abstain from
caffeine for 4 h prior to each session and to administer their
inhaled bronchodilator 30 min before each session. Subjects wore
the same footwear on both study days.
On each study day, two 6MWTs were performed with a
minimum 1-h rest between tests. One 6MWT was performed
unaided, and the other was performed using a rollator (Opal
Legacy; Dolmite; Markham, ON, Canada). The test order was
randomized (random numbers table) for the first day and re-
versed on the second day. The same rollator was used for all
subjects (Fig 1). The height was adjusted to ensure that the
handle bars were at the level of the subject’s ulnar styloid
process,16 and this was kept consistent for both study days.
Walk Tests
The 6MWTs were conducted in an enclosed corridor that was
60 m long and 3.4 m wide. Pylons were placed at either end of the
course. The tests were performed under quiet conditions with a
minimum of distractions and corridor traffic. All subjects per-
formed at least two practice walks before data collection in order
to control for learning and practice effects.17,18 Standardized
instructions were provided to subjects, and no encouragement
was offered during the tests.19 Subjects were requested to cover
as much ground as possible during the test period, stopping only
if they felt too tired or too breathless to continue, and to resume
walking as soon as they were able to do so. Subjects were
accompanied by the tester for each 6MWT. The tester walked
behind the subject in order to avoid pacing. The tester pushed a
wheeled cart on which the monitoring and acquisition equipment
was placed. For subjects using supplemental oxygen, the portable
oxygen canister also was carried on the wheeled cart.
Measures
Primary Measures: Functional exercise capacity was the pri-
mary outcome of this study and was evaluated by 6MWT
distance, duration of rest, and modified Borg ratings of dys-
pnea.20,21 Distance walked was automatically recorded using a
photosensing device (Photoelectric Switch; Omron Corporation;
Tokyo, Japan), which was placed on the wheel of the tester’s cart.
Secondary Measures: Secondary measures were those of car-
diorespiratory function and gait. Cardiorespiratory function in-
cluded oxygen saturation and heart rate, which were acquired
continuously with a finger probe pulse oximeter (Biox 3700;
Ohmeda; Madison, WI). Respiratory rate, minute volume, and
the phase relationships between the rib cage and abdominal
excursions22,23 were monitored using a respiratory inductance
plethysmograph (Respitrace; Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc; Ards-
ley, NY). This method has been validated during both treadmill
and cycle ergometer exercise.23–25 The rib cage band was placed
just under the axilla, and the abdominal band was placed below

the lowest vertebral rib, just above the iliac crest.26–28 The bands
were placed directly on the subject’s skin, as recommended by the
manufacturer, and were secured by surgical tape.29 The electronic
oscillator unit then was taped to the chest wall to eliminate artifacts
caused by movement of the unit.25,28 The plethysmograph was
calibrated before each 6MWT with a volume spirometer (Spiroflow;
PK Morgan Ltd; Rainham, Gillingham, UK).
Gait was evaluated by stride length using a self-developed
stride counter, and overall walking speed was calculated by
dividing the distance walked in 6 min by the duration of actual
walking time (ie, the duration of rest was subtracted from the
6 min).
Other: Demographic, descriptive data and recent spirometry
results were extracted from each subject’s medical chart.
Subjects completed the St. George’s Respiratory Disease
Questionnaire (SGRDQ) during the study week and a stan-
dardized preference questionnaire on completion of the study.
In the preference questionnaire, subjects were asked to
identify their preference for walking during the 6MWT either
with or without the rollator and their reasons for this prefer-
ence. Weight-bearing by the upper extremities while using the
rollator was measured by four strain gauges (LY Series
Uniaxial Gauge; Omega Engineering Inc; Laval, QC, Canada)
mounted on two force-measuring aluminum beams that were
placed under the handle bars.
Data Acquisition
Signals from the respiratory inductance plethysmograph, vol-
ume spirometer, distance sensor, pulse oximeter, upper extremity
weight-bearing sensors, and stride counter were sampled at 100 Hz
using a laptop computer (Satellite Pro 410CS; Toshiba; Tokyo,
Japan) with a data acquisition card (DAQCard-AI-16XE-50; Na-
tional Instruments; Austin, TX) and data acquisition and processing
software (LabVIEW, version 5.1; National Instruments).
Statistical Analysis
A sample size estimation using a two-tailed test with a type 1
error of 0.05 and power of 90% determined that a clinically
significant difference in 6MWT distance (mean, 54 m30) would
be detected with a minimum of 16 subjects (SD, 86 m). However,
to allow for the potential of using multiple linear regression with
at least three variables, a sample size of 40 was sought. This
estimation was based on the method of Norman and Streiner31 in
which the recommended sample size is 5 to 10 times the number
of variables included in the regression equation.
Data were analyzed for the total sample and for the subgroup
of subjects with greater disability who walked  300 m unaid-
ed.4,32 Variables were described for the total 6MWT, as well as
for individual minutes of each 6MWT. Means, SDs, and SEs
were calculated for all measures. Descriptive statistics also were
used for age, height, weight, FEV1, health-related quality of life,
subject preference, and upper extremity weight-bearing. Differ-
ences in outcomes for the 6MWTs conducted with and without
the rollator and for study day were analyzed using a two-way
repeated-measures analysis of variance.
Univariate regression was used to explore the relationship
between change in functional exercise capacity (ie, distance
walked or perception of dyspnea) with the rollator and indepen-
dent variables such as age, FEV1, use of supplemental oxygen,
etc. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to determine
the relationship between the significant variables and the change
in functional exercise capacity using the rollator.
Statistical analysis and graphing were undertaken using two
statistical software packages (SigmaStat, version 2.03, and Sig-
maPlot, version 5.0; SPSS Inc; Chicago, IL). For all statistical
analyses, p values of  0.05 were considered to be significant.
Results
Results are expressed as the mean of measure-
ments taken on the two study days. No significant
difference for study day was observed for any of the
outcomes of interest.

Sample Characteristics
Twenty-one male subjects and 19 female subjects
with severe COPD (mean [ SE] FEV1, 36.1 2.0%
predicted; FEV1/FVC ratio, 38.5 2.0%; Pao2,
65.2 1.6 mm Hg; Paco2, 44.1 0.9 mm Hg; oxyhe-
moglobin saturation, 91.9 0.6%) participated in the
study. Ten of the subjects used supplemental oxygen
during exertion. Of the 40 subjects, 19 walked 300 m
during the unaided 6MWT. Subject characteristics are
shown in Table 1.
Primary Outcomes
6MWT Distance: Walking distance increased with
the use of the rollator among subjects who walked
 300 m unaided (with rollator [WR], 242.5 14.2 m;
no rollator [NR], 220.3 12.0 m; p 0.02),
whereas it was unchanged in the total sample (WR,
317.0 15.7 m; NR, 311.6 16.6 m; p 0.3) and
in those who walked  300 m unaided (WR,
384.4 16.4 m; NR, 394.3 13.9 m; p  0.1)
[Fig 2].
The mean distance walked for each minute of the
6MWT for the total sample and for subjects who
walked  300 m and  300 m is shown in Figure 3.
In both the total sample and the subgroup of subjects
who walked 300 m unaided, there was a decline in
distance walked during the middle of the 6MWT (ie,
minutes 2 to 4) and an increase in the distance
walked at the end portion of the test (ie, minutes 4 to

6). This pattern was consistent regardless of rollator
use, but it was not present among subjects who
walked  300 m and was likely due to the require-
ment of rest during the middle potion of the 6MWT
in those who walked  300 m.
For the total sample, subjects walked further
unaided during the first minute of the 6MWT (WR,
54.4 2.4 m; NR, 57.3 2.2 m; p 0.001) with no
differences in distance walked for minutes 2, 3, 4, 5,
and 6 (p 0.1). The interaction between time (ie,
minutes) and the use of the rollator was significant
(p 0.001). Those subjects who walked  300 m
unaided also walked slightly further in the first
minute unaided (WR, 44.1 2.2 m; NR, 47.8 1.8 m;
p  0.001), however, they walked significantly fur-
ther with the rollator for minute 3 (WR, 40.4 2.2 m;
NR, 34.0 1.9 m; p 0.01), minute 4 (WR,
35.7 3.1 m; NR, 28.3 3.2 m; p 0.03), minute 5
(WR; 37.3 3.5 m; NR, 31.4 3.5 m; p 0.02),
and minute 6 (WR, 39.9 3.8 m; NR, 34.3 3.9 m;
p  0.02). The interaction between time and rollator
use was also significant (p 0.001). The distance
walked each minute was less variable with use of the
rollator (Fig 3, middle, B).
Duration of Rest: Subjects rested for a mean
( SE) time of 11.9 5.8 s with the rollator com-
pared to 31.2 8.7 s without the rollator (p 0.001;
Fig 4). This reduction in resting time when using the
rollator was even greater when it was calculated for
the group of subjects who walked  300 m unaided
(WR, 24.3 11.6 m; NR, 64.7 15.0 s; p 0.001)
[Fig 4]. Rest duration for each 6MWT was associated
with a single rest for the majority of subjects.
Modified Borg Rating of Dyspnea: The rollator
was associated with a statistically significant reduc-
tion in dyspnea in the total sample (WR, 1.8 0.2
unit change; NR, 2.7 0.3 unit change; p 0.001).
This observation persisted when the results were
analyzed separately for those who walked  300 m
unaided (WR, 1.8 0.3 unit change; NR, 3.2 0.4
unit change; p 0.001) and for those who walked
 300 m unaided (WR, 1.7 0.2 unit change; NR,
2.2 0.3 unit change; p 0.03) [Fig 5].
Secondary Outcomes
Cardiorespiratory Function: Use of the rollator
did not influence oxygen saturation during the
6MWT among the total group (p 0.2) or among
those who walked  300 m unaided (p 0.1) [Fig 6].
Heart rate decreased slightly with the rollator (WR,
102.5 1.8 beats/min; NR, 105.9 1.9 beats/min;
p 0.02) due to lower heart rates in minutes 1 and 6 of
the 6MWT (p 0.03). No significant difference was
found for those who walked  300 m unaided
(p 0.2). There were no changes in respiratory rate
(p 0.4), minute volume (p 0.4), or phase relation-
ships between the rib cage and abdominal excursions
(p 0.5) with use of the rollator for the total sample or
for those who walked  300 m unaided.
Gait: There was no difference in stride length
during the 6MWT when using the rollator among the
total sample (p 0.2) or for those who walked
 300 m unaided (p 0.2). Use of the rollator was
associated with a slight reduction in walking speed
for the total sample (WR, 54.4 2.4 m/min; NR,
56.1 2.2 m/min; p 0.007). No difference was
observed for the subjects who walked  300 m
unaided (p 0.1).
Upper Extremity Weight-Bearing: The amount of
upper extremity weight applied to the rollator was

5.0 0.3 kg (7.0 0.4% of body weight) for the
total group and 5.5 0.5 kg (7.4 0.6% of body
weight) for those who walked 300 m unaided. The
amount of weight applied to the rollator was unre-
lated to changes in distance walked (r  0.3;
p  0.1) or dyspnea ratings (r  0.3; p 0.3) with
use of the rollator.
Subject Preference: Fifty percent of subjects
(n 20) preferred walking with the rollator, 17.5%
(n 7) had no preference, and 32.5% (n 13)
preferred to walk unaided. Of the 19 subjects who
walked  300 m unaided, 14 (74%) preferred using
the rollator, 1 had no preference, and 4 preferred to
walk unaided. The number and percentage of sub-
jects agreeing with specific statements pertaining to
the use of the rollator are shown in Table 2.
Regression Analysis: Baseline measures of impair-
ment (FEV1), disability (unaided 6MWT distance of
 300 m or  300 m), and quality of life (SGRDQ
scores), as well as other variables such as oxygen use,
resting during the unassisted 6MWT, and baseline
dyspnea ratings, were evaluated by simple regression
analysis to identify potential predictors of improve-
ment in functional exercise capacity with use of the
rollator (Table 3). The unaided 6MWT distance and
the requirement for a rest during the 6MWT were
significant for both improvement in distance walked
and dyspnea rating. Stepwise regression analysis
revealed that requiring a rest during the unaided
6MWT was predictive of improvement in both dis-
tance walked and perception of dyspnea with use of
the rollator (Table 4). There was a strong and
significant relationship between requiring a rest
and the unaided 6MWT distance (r  0.67;
p  0.001).
Discussion
We have extended the observations reported on
the use of wheeled walking aids in patients with
COPD4,10–13 to include a larger sample size, stan-
dardized walking tests, and measures of weight
transferred to the rollator. We also evaluated the
characteristics that are most likely to be associated
with an improvement in functional exercise capacity
among a homogeneous population of patients with
severe disease. Use of a rollator reduced dyspnea and
rest time during walking among stable subjects with
severe COPD. For individuals who walked  300 m
unaided, the distance walked also increased.
Functional capacity has been defined as the ability
to undertake physically demanding activities of daily
living.33 An improvement in functional capacity can
be manifested by walking further or by being less
breathless for the same distance walked.34 In this
study, all of the subjects experienced a reduction in
dyspnea with the rollator. Dyspnea is a distressing
sensation that limits exercise tolerance, and, as such,
some clinicians regard it as a primary outcome
measure in the rehabilitation of patients with
COPD.35–37 It has been suggested that a 1-unit
change represents the minimum clinically important
difference for dyspnea ratings using the modified
Borg scale (Denis O’Donnell, MD; personal commu-
nication; April 6, 2000). The use of a rollator resulted
in a 1-unit reduction in the perception of dyspnea for
the total sample and a 1.4-unit reduction for those
patients who were most disabled. These results are

consistent with reports by Honeyman and col-
leagues4 and Dalton and colleagues,13 who found a
reduction in dyspnea of  1 unit with the use of a
rollator.
Subjects with greater disability (ie, 6MWT dis-
tance,  300 m) walked further WR. Although a
minimal change in 6MWT distance of 54 m has been
suggested as the threshold for a clinically important
improvement, this value is based on a COPD popu-
lation with an average 6MWT distance of 371 m.30
Given that our subgroup walked 220 m during the
unaided 6MWT, the smaller improvement of 22 m is
likely to be meaningful, especially since it was ac-
companied by a reduction in dyspnea. Honeyman
and colleagues4 and Wesmiller and Hoffman12 have
reported comparable improvements with the use of a
rollator among individuals with similar levels of
disability. The improvements observed among the
more disabled subjects may be especially important
as improvements in exercise performance and health
status in patients with COPD after an exercise
program may depend on the severity of their disabil-
ity. Wedzicha and colleagues38 noted that although
patients with moderate disability (ie, Medical Re-
search Council dyspnea grades 3 and 4) who were
mobile outside of their homes showed improvements
in exercise capacity following rehabilitation, those
with severe disability (ie, Medical Research Council
dyspnea grade 5) who were largely housebound
showed no improvement in exercise performance
following individualized physical training. Therefore,
for patients with severe disability and poor physical
fitness, the provision of a rollator might offer a useful
adjunct to rehabilitation in reducing dyspnea and
increasing exercise tolerance.
The outcome of rest duration has received little
attention in the literature. In a review of studies that
used time-based walking tests to evaluate functional
exercise capacity, Menard-Rothe and colleagues39
found none that reported total rest time as an
outcome. We included a measure of rest duration as
this information allows a clearer understanding of
the walk test.39 Our finding of a reduction in rest
time of 19 s for the total group and 40 s for the more
disabled subgroup supports the benefit of using a
rollator, especially when considered in conjunction
with the reduction in dyspnea and the improvement
in walking distance observed among the more dis-
abled subjects.
The use of the rollator was not associated with
changes in ventilation or breathing pattern, an ob-
servation that is in agreement with that of Grant and
Capel,11 who used a respirometer to measure minute
ventilation in five men with COPD and noted no
change when they walked with a wheeled walking
aid. Improvement in ventilation using the rollator
may be contingent on being able to adopt the
“forward-lean” position frequently seen among pa-
tients with COPD.40 This position is thought to
improve the effectiveness of the diaphragm, thereby
reducing work of breathing.40,41 Whereas other stud-
ies on wheeled walking aids have used high-wheeled
walkers10,11,14 or have adjusted the height of the aid
for comfort,12 we standardized the height of the
rollator, using the approach that most clinicians
adopt when prescribing walking frames.16,42 It is
possible that the height of the rollator may have been
too low to facilitate this forward-lean position.
Improvement with the rollator was not dependent
on the actual amount of weight applied to the
rollator, which was only 7% of the subject’s body
weight. However, the provision of arm support likely

did contribute to the improvement. Individuals with
COPD often breathe with their accessory respiratory
muscles including those of the upper arm and shoul-
der girdle, which have roles both in the maintenance
of ventilation and in postural stabilization.43,44 When
the arms are unsupported, such as in arm swing
during ambulation, the accessory muscles increase
their participation in the postural support of the
chest wall. To reduce dyspnea, individuals often
stabilize their arms.45 This stabilization enables the
arm and shoulder girdle muscles to act more effec-
tively as accessory muscles of respiration.46 There-
fore, the rollator may have facilitated a reduction in
dyspnea by enabling the users to stabilize their upper
limbs during walking, thereby improving the effec-
tiveness of their accessory muscles.43,44 In this study,
we did not evaluate the electromyographic activity of
accessory muscles.
Dyspnea is also influenced by emotion.47 During
exercise, an individual may breathe hard and not
experience the sensation of dyspnea because such
exertion is not accompanied by a sense of anxiety
over the adequacy of ventilation.48 Additionally, the
sensation of dyspnea may occur without a corre-
sponding change in ventilation or gas exchange.48
Therefore, patients with COPD who are anxious may
experience more dyspnea for a given amount of work
than those who are not. Use of the rollator may have
provided sufficient reassurance to reduce anxiety
during walking to result in a reduction in their
perception of dyspnea without a corresponding
change in ventilation. We may in fact have underes-
timated the benefit of a rollator among individuals
with severe COPD as, in the course of modifying the
rollator to incorporate the measurement of upper
extremity weight-bearing, we removed the seat. The
seat provides the user with the security of knowing
that he/she can rest at anytime and may, therefore,
serve to further reduce the anxiety and fear many
individuals with COPD have when embarking on
community ambulation.
Stride length and walking speed have been shown
to be altered when using various types of wheeled
walking aids, especially among older subjects with no
underlying lung disease.6,49–51 Although neither
changed in the current study, we did observe
changes in minute-to-minute variability of distance
walked, reflecting improved pacing, especially
among subjects with greater disability (Fig 3).
Finally, we noted that the majority of subjects,
especially individuals with greater disability, pre-
ferred using the rollator to walking unaided. Those
who did not reported concerns of the perceived
stigma associated with using a mobility aid and its

mately $495 [in Canadian dollars]). Therefore, it is
important to address the patient’s preferences prior
to a making a clinical recommendation.52,53
Conclusion
The use of a rollator reduced dyspnea and rest
duration in stable patients with severe COPD. Those
who walked  300 m unaided or required a rest
during the 6MWT benefited the most from use of
the rollator, as in this group walking distance also
increased. The improvement was not associated with
alterations in cardiorespiratory function or gait. The
effect of rollator height and its influence on respira-
tory muscle function, as well as the long-term effects
of rollator use on functional exercise capacity and
health-related quality of life will further advance our
understanding of the indications for recommending
the use of a rollator to patients with COPD.
