Hospital admissions for heart failure are common and
appear to be increasing in frequency[1,2]. These admis-
sions account for 1–1·5% of total health budgets in
developed countries[1,3], with out-patient management
costs contributing at least another 0·5–1%. In addition,
quality of life for patients with heart failure is often
markedly impaired. While pharmacological therapy has
established benefits in the treatment of patients with
heart failure, clinical outcomes may be improved further
by non-pharmacological strategies. Several studies have
now shown that multidisciplinary, home-based inter-
ventions for patients with heart failure[4–6] can reduce
hospital readmissions and improve quality of life.
Education, counselling and ongoing support for patients
with heart failure would appear essential for effective
long-term management[7].
Hospital-based specialist heart failure clinics have
been advocated to improve long-term management[8].
However, such clinics are expensive to run and at
present are often limited to tertiary institutions with
specific purposes such as heart transplantation orRandomized, controlled

hospital readmissions in patients with chronic heart failure.
Methods and Results This trial was a cluster randomized,
controlled trial of integrated primary/secondary care com-
pared with usual care for patients with heart failure. The
intervention involved clinical review at a hospital-based
heart failure clinic early after discharge, individual and
group education sessions, a personal diary to record
medication and body weight, information booklets and
regular clinical follow-up alternating between the general
practitioner and heart failure clinic. Follow-up was for
12 months. One hundred and ninety-seven patients admit-
ted to Auckland Hospital with an episode of heart failure
were enrolled in the study. There was no significant differ-
ence between the intervention and control groups for the
combined end-point of death or hospital readmission. The
physical dimension of quality of life showed a greaterwas attributable to the prevention of multiple admissions
(56 intervention group vs 95 control group, 2P=0·015) and
associated reduction in bed days.
Conclusions This integrated management programme for
patients with chronic heart failure improved quality of life
and reduced total hospital admissions and total bed days.

of randomization. General practitioners (GPs) were
randomly allocated, using computer-generated random
numbers, to either the intervention or control groups.
After consent was obtained, the patient was informed
of their group allocation based on the randomization
of their current general practitioner. The GP was
approached regarding the study and informed of their
patient’s participation. No GP approached in this way
declined to take part in the study.
Details of the clinical history, physical examination,
blood biochemistry, ECG and chest radiograph were
recorded at baseline. A transthoracic echocardiogram
was performed in all subjects and ejection fraction
measured (biplane Simpson’s method) using an
Acuson 128 or ATL HDI5000 ultrasound machine. The

for assessment of quality of life, was administered by
trained interviewers. The study team had no input intoaims of this study were to determine the effects of an

Methods
The study was a randomized, controlled single centre
study. Eligible patients were those admitted to the
general medical wards at Auckland Hospital with a
primary diagnosis of heart failure. Exclusion criteria
were kept to a minimum to allow a wide range of
patients to be enrolled. Exclusions included: (i) a surgi-
cally remediable cause for heart failure, such as severe
aortic stenosis, (ii) consideration for heart transplanta-
tion, (iii) inability to provide informed consent, (iv)
terminal cancer and (v) participation in any other clini-
cal trial. Potentially eligible patients were reviewed dur-
ing their hospital stay by the study team. Heart failure
was diagnosed on the basis of typical symptoms and
signs, with review of the chest radiograph, ECG and
echocardiogram. The Auckland Ethics Committee
approved the study and written informed consent was
obtained from each patient during the index admission
just prior to hospital discharge.

Intervention
Patients randomized to the intervention group were
scheduled for an outpatient clinical review with the
Eur Heart J, Vol. 23, issue 2, January 2002this initial clinic visit the patient’s clinical status was
reviewed, with particular attention to possible remedi-
able exacerbating factors. Pharmacological treatment
was based on evidence-based guidelines current at the
time of the study[10]. One-on-one education with the
study nurse was initiated at the first clinic visit. A patient
diary, for daily weights, medication record, clinical notes
and appointments, and education booklet were provided
(see acknowledgements). A follow-up plan was devised
for each patient aiming for 6-weekly visits alternating
between the GP and heart failure clinic, although the
patients were free to see their GPs at any time they
wished. A detailed letter was faxed to the GP on the
same day as the patient visited the heart failure clinic.
This letter included summary comments outlining
the rationale for any changes in treatment, and was
followed-up with a phone call to the patient’s GP to
discuss any relevant changes in the management plan.
The aim was for a close liaison between the patient and
family, the GP and the hospital heart failure clinic. GPs
made changes to the patient’s management as they saw
fit but were encouraged to discuss aspects of the patient’s
management with the clinic team at any stage.
Subsequently, group education sessions (each lasting
1·5–2 h) were offered, two within 6 weeks of hospital
discharge and a further after 6 months. These sessions
were run by a cardiologist and the study nurse. The
content of the one-on-one and group education included
explanation of the symptoms and signs of heart failure,
importance of monitoring of daily body weight and
action plans should weight change, effects of medica-
tions and importance of compliance and recommenda-
tions regarding exercise and diet. The advice given was
individualized and reinforced at each subsequent clinic
visit by the study nurse. Monitoring of daily weights,
with documentation in the diary and knowing what
action to take should weight change, was reinforced at
every available opportunity, either in the clinic or during
phone calls with the patient. No assistance with travel
costs or other incentives were provided for the patients
in the intervention group.
The study team at the hospital heart failure clinic was
available for consultation during normal working hours
and received calls from both patients and their GPs. At
times of worsening symptoms patients were initially
advised to see their GP. No explicit criteria for readmis-
sion were pre-specified and the decision to request
admission rested with the GP. If admission was not
required then an earlier heart failure clinic visit could be
arranged.
Patients randomized to the control group continued
under the care of their GP with additional follow-up
measures as usually recommended by the medical team
responsible for their in-patient care.in-patient stay. Thus the study commenced from the
time of discharge following the index admission,
although the actual intervention was delayed until the
first outpatient visit following discharge.Study end-points and data collection
Primary end-points were (1) combined end-point of
death or hospital readmission (time to first event) and
ence between the two groups for the combined end-point
of death or readmission. Thus, recruitment was stopped,

NYHA (index admission)with a total of 197 patients randomized. Follow-up to
12 months continued to allow completion of the quality
of life and total readmission end-points.
Data were analysed using two approaches. Firstly the
unit of randomization was assumed to be the individual,
as if simple randomization had been performed. Differ-
ences between treatment arms in categorical variables
over 12 months were tested using Fisher’s Exact test,
whilst differences in continuous variables were sought
using Student’s t-test. In other analyses the unit of
randomization was the GP, consistent with the actual
method of cluster randomization. Similar analyses were
performed where the average value per GP was weighted
by the number of patients the GP contributed, by taking
the proportion of patients in each general practice as the
dependent variable and comparing a weighted mean
between groups. Since the median number of partici-
pants per general practitioner was small (1·5 in each
arm) the influence of clustering was small and only
results from the first approach are presented. In no case(2) quality of life questionnaire[9]. Secondary end-
points included: (a) all-cause hospital readmissions;
(b) all-cause hospital bed days; and (c) readmissions for
worsening heart failure.
Patients were followed for 1 year. All surviving
patients were invited for a clinical review after
12 months. At this visit the patient’s symptoms and signs
were determined and the quality of life questionnaires
repeated. Blood was drawn for electrolytes and renal
function, and the ECG and echocardiogram were re-
peated. For patients who were unable to attend the
12-month visit, information regarding clinical status and
medication usage was obtained from primary care
records. Data on deaths and hospitalizations after ran-
domization were collected and reviewed at the time of
the 12-month visit. Extensive checks for hospital admis-
sions during the 12 months were made from patient
reporting, GP records and hospital databases. Deaths
were verified from death certificates and all hospital
admissions were checked with the hospital records.
Statistical analysis
A provisional sample size of 180 patients per group was
estimated to provide at least 80% power at the 0·05 level
of statistical significance to detect a 30% reduction in the
combined end-point of death or hospital readmission.
Because of uncertainty of the actual rates of death or
hospital readmission in this patient group, an indepen-
dent interim analysis was prospectively planned after
100 patients had been followed for 6 months to allow
recalculation of sample size. This independent analysis
showed higher than expected event rates but no differ-did statistical significance differ depending upon the
approach adopted.
The combined end-point of death or hospital readmis-
sion was analysed on a time to first event basis using theNZ European 77 79

Results
One hundred and ninety seven patients were enrolled in
the study (100 in the intervention group (64 GPs) and 97
in the control (68 GPs)). The groups were well matched
at baseline (Table 1). The mean age at entry to the study
was 73 years (SD 10·8). Three quarters of the patients
were classified as being in NYHA functional class IV on

Failure questionnaire). Minnesota score is positively scorecare. The study involved a broad range of patients who
are representative of those from a general hospital
setting. The study demonstrated improvements in the
physical dimensions of quality of life, and a reduction in
multiple hospital admissions over 12 months. While
many have advocated the benefits of such integrated
management[8], this is the first evidence of benefit from a
randomized controlled trial. The intervention group
received support and education from their general prac-
titioner, a specialist at the heart failure clinic and a nurse
practitioner. Early clinical review occurred after hospital
discharge and education was provided both individually
and in group sessions. Follow-up was shared between
the general practitioner and heart failure clinic with easy
access to the clinic as required. There were 34 fewer
hospital readmissions and 96 less bed days in the inter-
vention group compared with the control group, with
the main effect attributable to the prevention of multiple
admissions. This overall effect, while relatively modest,
is likely to be a reliable indication of the effect of this
management approach and generalisable to similar

may, in part, have occurred as the intervention did not
start until after the patients were discharged following
the index admissions. Thus there was a lag time until the
intervention started when patients attended the first
heart failure clinic visit (median of 11 days). Given the
delayed effect of the intervention it is possible that the
effect may continue and perhaps be greater in second or
subsequent years, although longer-term follow-up would
be required to determine this. The control group also

ng standard
overall effects are more modest than seen with the
home-based interventions. Further benefits may beappears to have received a good standard of care in the
Auckland setting. This may reflect the influence of local
clinical research, opinion leaders and clinical practice
guidelines. ACE inhibitors, as one clinical indicator,
were used in 89% of the control group at baseline.
Dosages may be considered suboptimal although it is
notable that the patients had markedly impaired renal
function, making lower dosages appropriate. Beta-
blocker therapy was minimal in this patient group, as
the study was carried out prior to the definitive beta-
blocker trials[11,12]. Some authors have advocated
audit of pharmacological therapy prior to using scarce
resources on nurse practitioners or clinics[13]. One com-
ponent of the intervention in the current study was to
review and optimize pharmacological therapy. There
were trends for more patients to be receiving ACE
inhibitor therapy and at a slightly higher dose, although
overall these were only relatively small changes and thus
it is unlikely that this alone would have accounted for
the beneficial effects observed.
The patients enrolled in the current study had mul-
tiple coexisting medical conditions, including diabetes,
chronic respiratory disease, prior stroke and gout, their
renal function was impaired and they were taking a
median of six medications. As such, this group are
representative of those patients commonly admitted to
medical wards with exacerbations of heart failure.
Readmission rates were high, although notably only a
third of readmissions in these patients were attributed
primarily to heart failure. The greatest effect of the
intervention was to almost halve the readmissions for
worsening heart failure. The high rate of readmissions
associated with other conditions highlights the need for
attention to co-morbidities as well as management of
heart failure. In the model in the current study a
cardiologist, nurse practitioner and general prac-
titioner were combined although greater benefits may be
gained by the involvement of general physicians and/or
geriatricians.
This study has important differences in design com-
pared with the other intervention trials in heart failure
management. In a study by Weinberger et al.[14], 1396
US Veterans with diabetes, congestive heart failure
(n=504) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were
randomly assigned to either an intensive primary care
intervention or usual care. Patients were identified at the
time of hospital admission although one of these three
medical conditions did not have to be the primary
reason for the admission. The intervention involved
close follow-up by a nurse and a primary care physician
beginning before discharge and continuing for 6 months.
The patients in the intervention group had significantly
higher rates of readmission than the controls (0·19 vs
0·14 per month, P=0·005). In addition, more patients in
the intervention group had multiple readmissions than
controls. One potential reason for the increase in admis-
sions may have been that the increased care may have
led to the detection of previously unrecognised medical
conditions that required admission for treatment. In
addition, a disease-specific protocol and integrationachieved with earlier intervention in hospital prior to
discharge, use of agents proven to reduce admissions
such as beta-blocker therapy[11,12], and further attention
to the co-morbidities commonly found in these patients.
It is important to remember that every patient has
different and distinct educational and medical needs
and thus flexible and practical approaches should be
employed that allow tailoring to individual needs.
The combined dataset from these trials is still
relatively small, and at present it is uncertain which
components of the interventions actually produces the
beneficial results observed. While the intervention trials
have utilized different designs, the heart failure nurse
practitioner is common to all the trials and appears to
have a key role in heart failure management. Further
studies are obviously required to develop these manage-
ment strategies further. It should be noted that such
management programmes have only been applied in
patients who have been admitted to hospital. Conse-
quently, there is no evidence of benefit in reducing theof primary with specialist care, as in the current study,
may be important requirements for the success of such
management programmes.
Cline et al.[15] studied the effects of a nurse-led
hospital-based clinic for the management of heart fail-
ure. The effects of this intervention were modest with an
increase in the time to first readmission but only a trend
to fewer hospital admissions in the intervention group.
The design of this study is different to the Auckland
study, as it did not involve a structured approach to
integration between the patient and primary and second-
ary care. Several studies have now demonstrated that
home-based multidiscipinary interventions can reduce
readmissions in patients with heart failure[4–6]. These
trials have, in general, targeted certain subgroups of
patients with heart failure and have demonstrated larger
effects of these interventions in these selected patient
subgroups. Provision of the management programmes
outside of the hospital setting, including home-visiting,
does appear to have a greater potential for benefit.
Implications for clinical practice
Hospital admissions for heart failure have consistently
increased over the last 10–20 years and the cost of these
admissions alone account for 1–1·5% of total health
budgets in most developed countries[3,16]. There is thus
an urgent need for strategies to reduce these admissions.
Several randomized, controlled trials have now assessed
different approaches in the management of patients with
heart failure[4,5,14,17–19]. The current study supports the
role of integrated management involving the patient/
family and primary and secondary care, although the

failure. In addition, the programmes have generally
only followed patients for a relatively short period
and the longer-term effects remain uncertain. Further

development of these evidence-based management pro-
grammes has the potential to improve the quality of life
for patients with heart failure and to reduce the public
health burden of this disease.
The study was funded by a project grant from the National
Heart of New Zealand and an unrestricted educational grant from
Rockville, MD., June, 1994.
