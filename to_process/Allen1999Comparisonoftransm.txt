Background
 
Transmyocardial revascularization in-
volves the creation of channels in the myocardium
with a laser to relieve angina. We compared the safety
and efficacy of transmyocardial revascularization per-
formed with a holmium laser with those of medical
therapy in patients with refractory class IV angina (ac-
cording to the criteria of the Canadian Cardiovascu-
lar Society).
 
Methods
 
In a prospective study conducted between
March 1996 and July 1998 at 18 centers, 275 patients
with medically refractory class IV angina and coro-
nary disease that could not be treated with percuta-
neous or surgical revascularization were randomly
assigned to receive transmyocardial revasculariza-
tion followed by continued medical therapy (132 pa-
tients) or medical therapy alone (143 patients).
 
Results
 
After one year of follow-up, 76 percent of
the patients who had undergone transmyocardial re-
vascularization had improvement in angina (a reduc-
tion of two or more classes), as compared with 32
percent of the patients who received medical ther-
apy alone (P<0.001). Kaplan–Meier survival esti-
mates at one year (based on an intention-to-treat
analysis) were similar for the patients assigned to
undergo transmyocardial revascularization and those
assigned to receive medical therapy alone (84 per-
cent and 89 percent, respectively; P=0.23). At one
year, the patients in the transmyocardial-revascu-
larization group had a significantly higher rate of
survival free of cardiac events (54 percent, vs. 31
percent in the medical-therapy group; P<0.001), a
significantly higher rate of freedom from treatment
failure (73 percent vs. 47 percent, P<0.001), and a
significantly higher rate of freedom from cardiac-
related rehospitalization (61 percent vs. 33 percent,
P<0.001). Exercise tolerance and quality-of-life scores
were also significantly higher in the transmyocar-
dial-revascularization group than in the medical-
therapy group (exercise tolerance, 5.0 MET [metabol-
ic equivalent] vs. 3.9 MET; P=0.05; quality-of-life
score, 21 vs. 12; P=0.003). However, there were no
differences in myocardial perfusion between the two
groups, as assessed by thallium scanning.
 
Conclusions
 
Patients with refractory angina who
underwent transmyocardial revascularization and re-
ceived continued medical therapy, as compared with
similar patients who received medical therapy alone,
had a significantly better outcome with respect to
improvement in angina, survival free of cardiac
events, freedom from treatment failure, and freedom
from cardiac-related rehospitalization. (N Engl J Med

ESPITE the success of current medical
and surgical management of ischemic heart
disease, a growing number of patients
have diffuse obstructive coronary artery
disease that is not amenable to coronary-artery by-
pass grafting or catheter-based interventions. This
problem has stimulated interest in developing alter-
native therapeutic approaches. Early attempts at in-
direct myocardial revascularization had limited suc-
cess. Beck’s use of omentopexy, reported in 1935,
 
1
 
and Vinberg’s use of thoracic-artery implantation,
reported in 1954,
 
2
 
 were attempts to provide direct
myocardial perfusion and were based on the descrip-
tion by Wearn et al., in 1933,
 
3
 
 of a sinusoidal net-
work in the human heart. In 1965, Sen et al. pro-
posed the creation of transmural channels in the left
ventricular wall to permit direct perfusion of ische-
mic myocardium with oxygenated left ventricular
blood.
 
4
 
 This concept was based on the model of the
reptilian heart, in which the left ventricle is directly
perfused from endothelium-lined channels that radi-
ate out from the left ventricular cavity. Mirhoseini
and associates
 
5,6
 
 advanced the concept by using laser
energy rather than mechanical energy to create the
transmural channels. Subsequent clinical trials using
a carbon dioxide laser
 
7-13
 
 or a holmium:yttrium–alu-
minum–garnet laser
 
14-16
 
 (hereafter referred to as a hol-
mium laser) demonstrated that transmyocardial revas-
cularization significantly improved angina in patients
who were not candidates for conventional therapies.
We conducted a prospective, randomized, multi-
center trial to compare the safety and efficacy of
transmyocardial revascularization, performed with a
holmium laser and followed by continued medical
therapy, with the safety and efficacy of medical ther-

apy alone in patients with refractory class IV angina
(according to the classification system of the Cana-
dian Cardiovascular Society [CCS]). Eighteen cen-
ters in the United States participated in the study.
 
METHODS
 
Patients
 
Between March 1996 and July 1998, 275 patients with medi-
cally refractory class IV angina and coronary artery disease that
could not be treated with percutaneous or surgical revasculariza-
tion were randomly assigned to undergo transmyocardial revascu-
larization and continued medical therapy (132 patients) or med-
ical therapy alone (143 patients). Randomization was performed
by each center on a 1:1 basis, with a block size of six patients per
center. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the pa-
tients in the two treatment groups were similar (Table 1). A blind-
ed, independent data and safety monitoring committee monitored
the study. Study approval was obtained from the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) and the institutional review board of each
participating center. Informed consent was obtained from each
patient before enrollment. 
The criteria for enrollment were refractory class IV angina that
was not amenable to coronary-artery bypass grafting or percuta-
neous transluminal coronary angioplasty (as determined by a sur-
geon and an interventional cardiologist at each center); reversible
ischemia, as determined by myocardial perfusion scanning, within
the distal two thirds of the left ventricle (i.e., the area of the ven-
tricle amenable to transmyocardial revascularization); and a left
ventricular ejection fraction greater than 25 percent. Exclusion
criteria were a contraindication to general anesthesia; severe chron-
ic obstructive pulmonary disease (indicated by a forced expiratory
volume in one second that was less than 55 percent of the pre-
dicted value); the need for continued use of intravenous antian-
gina medications; an inability to undergo dipyridamole–thallium
stress scintigraphy; a non–Q-wave myocardial infarction within the
previous two weeks or a Q-wave myocardial infarction within the
previous three weeks; the need for long-term anticoagulant ther-
apy; the presence of a ventricular mural thrombus; severe arrhyth-
mias; and decompensated congestive heart failure. 
Medically refractory angina was defined as CCS class IV angina
that was present despite maximal tolerated doses of multiple an-
tianginal medications (nitrates, calcium-channel blockers, and beta-
blockers). At the time of enrollment, 91 percent of the patients
(250 of 275) were taking two or more antianginal medications,
and 31 percent (85 of 275) were taking analgesics or narcotics. 
Forty-six patients (32 percent) initially assigned to receive med-
ical therapy alone met the a priori criteria for treatment failure
and could not be weaned from intravenous antianginal medica-
tion on two attempts over a period of 48 hours. They were with-
drawn from the study and underwent transmyocardial revascular-
ization under a parallel, FDA-approved protocol for patients who
could not be weaned from intravenous antianginal medications.
Thus, there were three groups of patients: those randomly as-
signed to undergo transmyocardial revascularization and to re-
ceive continued medical therapy (132 patients), those who received
medical therapy alone throughout the study (97), and those ran-
domly assigned to receive medical therapy alone who met the cri-
teria for treatment failure and underwent transmyocardial revas-
cularization as part of a separate protocol (46). The third group
of patients is hereafter referred to as the crossover group.
 
Operative Technique and Laser Procedure
 
The operative procedure has been described in detail else-
where.
 
14,15
 
 Cardiac exposure was accomplished through a limited
left anterior thoracotomy. The administration of intravenous flu-
ids was minimized to prevent fluid overload. A 20-W, pulsed hol-
mium laser (Eclipse Surgical Technologies, Sunnyvale, Calif.) was
used to create transmyocardial channels. The laser, which has
been approved by the FDA, was calibrated to deliver 6 to 8 W per
pulse, and energy was delivered at the rate of five pulses per sec-
ond through a flexible 1-mm optical fiber. Energy application was
not gated to the cardiac cycle. Channels were placed every square
centimeter throughout the distal two thirds of the left ventricle.
Three to five channels were placed, followed by the application of
digital pressure for two to three minutes to obtain hemostasis and
allow for myocardial recovery. Mechanical manipulation of the
heart was minimized. A mean (±SD) of 39±11 channels were
created per patient. The mean durations of surgery and laser use
were 99±43 and 25±13 minutes, respectively.
 
Primary End Points
 
The primary end points were a change in angina symptoms,
treatment failure, and a change in myocardial perfusion. Angina
was evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months in all surviving patients who
were not crossed over to surgical treatment and who had reached
the designated follow-up time (hereafter referred to as eligible pa-
tients): 213 of 221 patients (96 percent) at 3 months, 172 of 183
(94 percent) at 6 months, and 126 of 136 (93 percent) at 12
months. Improvement in angina was defined as a reduction of
two or more CCS angina classes from base line. An independent
laboratory (at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland) con-
ducted a masked assessment of angina and quality of life at 12
months. Angina was assessed with the use of a questionnaire de-
signed to classify the symptoms of angina according to the CCS
class (with class 0 indicating the absence of angina). The Duke
Activity Status Index
 
17
 
 was used to assess the quality of life. The
index is based on a scale from 0 to 58, with higher scores indi-
cating greater functional capacity. Among the first 160 patients
enrolled in the study, these assessments were performed at 12
months in 112 of 132 eligible patients (85 percent). 
Treatment failure in both the transmyocardial-revascularization
group and the medical-therapy group was defined a priori as
death, Q-wave myocardial infarction, two cardiac-related hospital-
izations within a 3-month period, three cardiac-related hospitaliza-
tions within a 12-month period, or an inability to withdraw in-
 
*Plus–minus values are means ±SD. None of the differences between
the treatment groups were statistically significant. CAD denotes coronary
artery disease, PTCA percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and
CABG coronary-artery bypass grafting.

travenous antianginal medications on at least two attempts in a
48-hour period. Data on treatment failure were available at 12
months for 273 of 275 patients (99 percent).
Myocardial perfusion was assessed with the use of dipyrida-
mole–thallium stress testing, with images obtained while the pa-
tient was at rest, under conditions of drug-induced stress, and af-
ter a four-hour delay. Imaging was performed at base line in all
patients and at 3, 6, and 12 months in the first 160 patients en-
rolled in the study. Computerized quantification of ischemic
changes, perfusion defects at rest, and delayed perfusion defects
was performed in a masked manner by an independent laboratory
(at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston), with the use of the
validated Emory/Cedars–Sinai software package, version 1.0. A
change in perfusion was defined as a difference of more than 10
percent from the base-line value. The 46 patients in the crossover
group underwent follow-up thallium scanning only at rest and
were excluded from this analysis. Computer-quantified, paired
scans (base-line and 12-month follow-up) were available for 61 of
95 eligible patients (64 percent).
 
Secondary End Points
 
Secondary end points included freedom from cardiac-related
rehospitalization, survival free of cardiac events, use of cardiac
medications, performance on an exercise treadmill test, and qual-
ity-of-life score. Freedom from cardiac-related rehospitalization,
occurrence of Q-wave and non–Q-wave myocardial infarction,
and survival free of cardiac events were evaluated at 3, 6, and 12
months. Survival free of cardiac events was defined as freedom
from death, Q-wave myocardial infarction, cardiac-related hospi-
talization, and subsequent coronary-artery bypass grafting or per-
cutaneous angioplasty.
The rates of use of cardioactive medications (calcium-channel
blockers, beta-blockers, and nitrates) and doses were determined
at base line and at 3, 6, and 12 months. The use of cardiac sup-
pressants (beta-blockers and calcium-channel blockers) was avoid-
ed during the first 48 hours after surgery, but treatment with ni-
trates, angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitors, and diuretics
was resumed after the operation. Cardioactive medications that had
been administered before surgery were continued for two months
after surgery and then gradually withdrawn, as tolerated, on the
basis of the patient’s anginal symptoms. An independent labora-
tory (at Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, Calif.) per-
formed a masked analysis of medication use at 12 months for the
first 160 patients enrolled in the study. Data were available for
126 of the 132 eligible patients (95 percent).
Exercise treadmill testing was not part of the original study de-
sign. Following a recommendation by the FDA, however, we
modified the protocol after the first 160 patients had been en-
rolled, eliminating follow-up thallium scanning and substituting
treadmill testing according to the Naughton protocol at 12 months.
No treadmill tests were performed at base line. Analysis of total
exercise time included only the 81 patients who underwent
Naughton testing; the 9 patients who underwent other types of
treadmill testing were excluded. To determine the average work-
load, expressed as metabolic equivalents (MET), Naughton and
non-Naughton test results were combined. The 11 patients who
were unable to exercise because of angina were assigned a score of
1 MET. Exercise treadmill tests were performed in 90 of 132 el-
igible patients (68 percent) at 12 months.
 
Statistical Analysis
 
Since 32 percent of the patients assigned to receive medical
therapy alone met the predefined criteria for treatment failure and
were withdrawn from this study to undergo transmyocardial re-
vascularization in a parallel, nonrandomized study, a modified ap-
proach to the statistical analysis was required for certain end points.
For definitive end points recorded before crossover (treatment
failure, survival free of cardiac events, and cardiac-related rehos-
pitalization), an intention-to-treat analysis was used. For end
points measured at 12 months (improvement in angina, results of
thallium scanning, myocardial-infarction rates, medication use,
quality-of-life scores, and performance on an exercise treadmill
test), the patients who underwent transmyocardial revasculariza-
tion were compared with the patients who received medical ther-
apy alone throughout the study. Survival at one year was deter-
mined with the use of both types of analyses.
A central laboratory using Statgraphics Plus, version 2.1, per-
formed all analyses of thallium scans. Base-line scans obtained at
rest, under conditions of stress, and after a four-hour delay were
compared with follow-up scans. Mean changes were calculated for
each variable, and Student’s t-test was used to analyze unpaired data. 
Kaplan–Meier estimates were used to compare the treatment
groups at one year with respect to mortality, survival free of car-
diac events, freedom from treatment failure, freedom from cardi-
ac-related hospitalization, and myocardial infarction. With the ex-
ception of the analysis of thallium scans, all analyses were
performed with the use of SAS software, versions 6.11 and 6.12
(SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.). The chi-square test and Student’s
t-test were used to compare qualitative and continuous variables,
respectively, and P values of 0.05 or lower on two-tailed testing
were considered to indicate statistical significance.
 
RESULTS
 
Primary End Points
 
Angina improved in a significantly larger propor-
tion of patients in the transmyocardial-revasculariza-
tion group than in the medical-therapy group at 3, 6,
and 12 months (P<0.001 for all three comparisons)
(Fig. 1). At 12 months, 76 percent of the patients in
the transmyocardial-revascularization group had im-
provement in angina (a reduction of two or more
CCS classes), as compared with only 32 percent of
 
Figure 1.
 
 Improvement in Angina at 3, 6, and 12 Months in Pa-

larization (TMR), Patients Who Received Medical Therapy Alone
Throughout the Study (MT), and Patients Assigned to Receive
Medical Therapy Who Met the Criteria for Treatment Failure
and Underwent Transmyocardial Revascularization (Crossover).
All patients had class IV angina at base line. The improvement
in angina in the medical-therapy group at 12 months reflects
the reduction in the number of patients in this group as the
sicker patients were withdrawn so that they could undergo
transmyocardial revascularization under a separate protocol.

patients in the medical-therapy group (P<0.001).
The proportion of patients in the crossover group
who had improvement in angina at 12 months was
similar to that in the transmyocardial-revasculariza-
tion group. The results of the masked assessment of
angina were closely correlated with the study inves-
tigators’ assessment and differed by no more than
one CCS class 80 percent of the time. 
In the intention-to-treat analysis, the rate of free-
dom from treatment failure at one year was signifi-
cantly higher in the transmyocardial-revasculariza-
tion group than in the medical-therapy group (73
percent vs. 47 percent, P<0.001) (Fig. 2). Patients
randomly assigned to receive medical therapy alone
were twice as likely to meet the a priori criteria for
treatment failure at 12 months as patients randomly
assigned to undergo transmyocardial revascularization.
Computer-quantified changes in perfusion between
base line and 12 months are shown in Figure 3. There
were no significant differences between the transmy-
ocardial-revascularization group and the medical-
therapy group with respect to changes in ischemia,
defects in perfusion at rest, or delayed defects. Further-
more, no correlation was noted between improvement
in angina and the results of thallium scanning. Since
laser energy ablates myocardial tissue, there was con-
cern that transmyocardial revascularization might im-
prove angina by creating zones of infarction; however,
no differences in fixed defects were noted.
 
Perioperative Morbidity and Mortality
 
The rate of perioperative (in-hospital or 30-day)
mortality after transmyocardial revascularization was
5 percent (7 of the 132 patients died), which includ-
ed 1 patient who died after randomization but be-
fore undergoing transmyocardial revascularization.
Five patients (4 percent) died from cardiac causes:
two from left ventricular dysfunction and three from
ventricular fibrillation. Two patients died from non-
cardiac causes: one each from respiratory insufficien-
cy and multisystem organ failure. The perioperative
mortality rate among the last 100 consecutively en-
rolled patients was 2 percent. Perioperative adverse
events in the transmyocardial-revascularization group
are shown in Table 2. The perioperative mortality
rate in the crossover group was 9 percent (4 of the
46 patients died). Two of the 97 patients (2 percent)
who received medical therapy alone throughout the
study died within 30 days after enrollment; both
deaths resulted from myocardial infarctions. The mor-
tality rates at 30 days in the transmyocardial-revascu-
larization, medical-therapy, and crossover groups did
not differ significantly (P=0.07).
In the intention-to-treat analysis, Kaplan–Meier
survival estimates at one year for the transmyocar-
dial-revascularization and medical-therapy groups did
not differ significantly (84 percent and 89 percent,
respectively; P=0.23) (Fig. 4). When the crossover
patients were considered separately, there were also
no significant differences in survival at one year (trans-
myocardial-revascularization group, 84 percent; med-
ical-therapy group, 88 percent; and crossover group,
91 percent; P=0.47) (Fig. 5).
 
Secondary End Points
 
In the intention-to-treat analysis, the Kaplan–Mei-
er estimate of survival free of cardiac events at one
year was significantly higher in the transmyocardial-
revascularization group than in the medical-therapy
group (54 percent vs. 31 percent, P<0.001). The
rate of freedom from cardiac-related rehospitalization
was also significantly higher in the transmyocardial-
 
Figure 2.

The difference between the groups was significant (P<0.001 by

P=0.17).
The rate of use of calcium-channel blockers at 12
months was lower in the group of patients who un-
derwent transmyocardial revascularization (44 per-
cent [26 of 59 patients]) than in the group that re-
ceived medical therapy alone (76 percent [32 of 42],
P=0.002). Similarly, the use of beta-blockers was
reduced or discontinued in 39 percent of the trans-
myocardial-revascularization group (28 of 72 pa-
tients), as compared with 17 percent of the medical-
therapy group (7 of 42, P=0.02). Although the
percentage of patients who decreased or discontinued
their use of nitrates was greater in the transmyocardial-
revascularization group than in the medical-therapy
group, the difference was not significant (P=0.12).
The higher rates of improvement in angina and free-
dom from treatment failure and the reduced rates of
cardiac-related rehospitalization and use of cardioac-
tive medications among the patients treated with trans-
myocardial revascularization, as compared with those
receiving medical therapy alone, were reflected in the
surgical group’s greater tolerance of exercise (5.0±
0.7 vs. 3.9±0.8 MET, P=0.05) and higher quality-of-
life score (21±14 vs. 12±11, P= 0.003) at 12 months.
 
DISCUSSION
 
Direct surgical or percutaneous revascularization
remains the mainstay of treatment for angina. Un-
fortunately, a subgroup of patients with medically
refractory angina have small or diffusely diseased
distal vessels that are not amenable to conventional
revascularization therapies. Transmyocardial revascu-
larization has been introduced to supplement medi-
cal management of this difficult condition.
The perioperative mortality rate after transmyo-
cardial revascularization performed with a carbon di-
oxide laser in patients with stable angina ranges from
1 to 20 percent.

 We performed transmyocardial
revascularization with a holmium laser in patients
with medically refractory class IV angina. The peri-
operative mortality rate in this group of patients was
5 percent (7 of 132 patients died); 5 of the 7 deaths
occurred during the first three months in which the

study was conducted. The perioperative mortality rate
in the last 100 consecutively enrolled patients was
2 percent, which was the same as the rate in the group
of patients who received medical therapy alone. The
rate of perioperative complications was low in view of
the coexisting conditions in this patient population.
In one study, transmyocardial revascularization
with a carbon dioxide laser resulted in a higher per-
ioperative mortality rate in patients with unstable
angina than in those with stable angina (27 percent
vs. 1 percent).
 
13
 
 In a study of transmyocardial revas-
cularization with a holmium laser in 85 patients who
could not be weaned from intravenous antianginal
medications, Dowling and associates reported an
operative mortality rate of 12 percent (10 of 85 pa-
tients died).
 
15
 
 In our study, the crossover group (pa-
tients in the medical-therapy group who could not
be weaned from intravenous antianginal medications
and underwent transmyocardial revascularization as
part of a separate protocol) and the transmyocardial-
revascularization group had similar rates of periop-
erative mortality (9 percent and 5 percent, respec-
tively; P=0.48), survival in the Kaplan–Meier analysis
(91 percent and 84 percent, respectively; P=0.53),
and improvement in angina at one year. These results
suggest that transmyocardial revascularization with a
holmium laser should be performed, when possible,
in patients with stable angina but that those with un-
stable angina should not be denied this procedure.
Ventricular arrhythmia was an early concern with
the use of lasers that were not gated to the cardiac
cycle. The perioperative rate of ventricular arrhyth-
mia in our trial was 12 percent, which is similar to
the 10 percent rate in clinical trials using a gated car-
bon dioxide laser.
 
18
 
Transmyocardial revascularization performed with
a holmium laser resulted in a significant improve-
ment in angina at one year in 76 percent of the pa-
tients in our study who underwent the procedure, as
compared with 32 percent of the patients who re-
ceived medical therapy alone. The subjective nature
of angina assessment introduces the possibility of bi-
as. Unlike previous studies,
 
7-13,19
 
 ours included an in-
dependent, masked evaluation of angina. There was
a strong correlation between the independent eval-
uation and that performed by the investigators, with
a discrepancy of no more than one CCS class 80
percent of the time. The proportion of patients who
reduced or ceased their use of cardioactive medica-
tions was significantly larger in the transmyocardial-
revascularization group than in the medical-therapy
group. Our findings are in agreement with those re-
ported by other investigators
 
8,9,13
 
 and support the
suggestion that relief of angina in patients treated
with transmyocardial revascularization is not due to
increased use of antianginal medications. Relief of
angina for up to four years has been reported in pa-
tients who underwent transmyocardial revasculariza-
tion with a carbon dioxide laser.
 
20
 
 Although the ben-
efit of transmyocardial revascularization in our patients
may have been due in part to a placebo effect, sus-
tained relief of angina and widely divergent Kaplan–
Meier curves at one year (P<0.001) for freedom
from treatment failure help refute the argument that
a placebo effect is an important mechanism for the
favorable results of transmyocardial revascularization. 
The success of transmyocardial revascularization is
thought to be due to improved regional blood flow
to ischemic myocardium, but the precise mechanisms
of its effects remain unclear. Although in our study
the patients treated with transmyocardial revascular-
ization had higher rates of improvement in angina,
freedom from treatment failure, and freedom from
cardiac-related rehospitalization, as well as better ex-
ercise tolerance and higher quality-of-life scores at
12 months, than the patients treated with medical
therapy alone, no significant differences in computer-
quantified reversible or fixed perfusion defects were
noted between the two groups.
Horvath and associates
 
9
 
 reported a small improve-
ment in perfusion after transmyocardial revascular-
ization performed with a carbon dioxide laser. These
results seemingly supported the hypothesis that trans-
myocardial revascularization improved myocardial
perfusion. However, the follow-up was incomplete,
the analysis was not computer-quantified, and im-
proved perfusion was poorly correlated with relief of
angina.
 
21
 
 In a prospective, randomized trial involv-
ing primarily patients with class III angina, Schofield
and associates
 
19
 
 compared transmyocardial revascu-
larization (performed with a carbon dioxide laser)
with medical therapy alone and were unable to dem-
onstrate improved perfusion on thallium scans ob-

 TRANSMYOCARDIAL REVASCULARIZATION VS. MEDICAL THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY ANGINA

tained after transmyocardial revascularization. Al-
though the proportion of patients with improvement
in angina was significantly larger in the transmyocar-
dial-revascularization group, it was lower than that
reported in previous studies.

 The lower rate of im-
provement in angina may reflect the enrollment of
patients with class III angina rather than class IV an-
gina. The failure to demonstrate improved perfusion
after transmyocardial revascularization may be due to
the low sensitivity of thallium scanning rather than
to the absence of an effect. Using positron-emission
tomography, Frazier and associates
 
7
 
 demonstrated an
improvement in subendocardial blood flow in 11 pa-
tients treated with transmyocardial revascularization.
Angiogenesis
 
22-24
 
 and sympathetic denervation25-27
are plausible mechanisms for the clinical results
achieved with transmyocardial revascularization. In-
flammatory cells recruited in response to laser-induced
myocardial injury may release angiogenic growth fac-
tors, and the actions of these growth factors may
result in neovascularization and improved regional
collateral flow. Sympathetic denervation may relieve
angina without influencing myocardial perfusion; this
would explain the immediate relief experienced by
some patients. The possibility that denervation may
lead to silent ischemia or infarction after transmyo-
cardial revascularization is less likely, since there was
no increase in fixed perfusion defects in our trans-
myocardial-revascularization group. The mechanism
of action of transmyocardial revascularization is prob-
ably multifactorial, with angiogenesis and denerva-
tion occurring concurrently. 
In this prospective, randomized, multicenter trial,
patients with medically refractory class IV angina
who underwent transmyocardial revascularization and
continued medical therapy had significantly higher
rates of improvement in angina, survival free of car-
diac events, freedom from treatment failure, and free-
dom from cardiac-related rehospitalization than pa-
tients who received medical therapy alone. Mortality
did not differ significantly between the two groups.
Although its mechanism of action is unknown, trans-
myocardial revascularization is a treatment option
for patients with medically refractory angina who are
not candidates for conventional revascularization.
