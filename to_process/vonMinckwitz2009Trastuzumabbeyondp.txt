Purpose
Trastuzumab shows clinical activity in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)–positive
early and advanced breast cancer. In the German Breast Group 26/Breast International Group 03-05
trial, we investigated if trastuzumab treatment should be continued beyond progression.
Methods
Patients with HER-2–positive breast cancer that progresses during treatment with trastuzumab
were randomly assigned to receive capecitabine (2,500 mg/m2 body-surface area on days 1
through 14 [1,250 mg/m2 semi-daily]) alone or with continuation of trastuzumab (6 mg/kg body
weight) in 3-week cycles. The primary end point was time to progression.
Results
We randomly assigned 78 patients to capecitabine and 78 patients to capecitabine plus
trastuzumab. Sixty-five events and 38 deaths in the capecitabine group and 62 events and 33
deaths in the capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group occurred during 15.6 months of follow-up.
Median times to progression were 5.6 months in the capecitabine group and 8.2 months in the
capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group with an unadjusted hazard ratio of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.48 to 0.97;
two-sided log-rank P  .0338). Overall survival rates were 20.4 months (95% CI, 17.8 to 24.7) in
the capecitabine group and 25.5 months (95% CI, 19.0 to 30.7) in the capecitabine-plus-
trastuzumab group (P  .257). Overall response rates were 27.0% with capecitabine and 48.1%
with capecitabine plus trastuzumab (odds ratio, 2.50; P  .0115). Continuation of trastuzumab
beyond progression was not associated with increased toxicity.
Conclusion
Continuation of trastuzumab plus capecitabine showed a significant improvement in overall
response and time to progression compared with capecitabine alone in women with HER-2–
positive breast cancer who experienced progression during trastuzumab treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Change of treatment at disease progression is a
general principle in oncology. It is not known
whether this holds true for novel biologic agents
like trastuzumab (Herceptin; Roche, Grenzach-
Wyhlen, Germany), a humanized monoclonal
antibody against the extracellular domain of hu-
man epidermal growth factor receptor type 2
(HER-2, also referred to as HER-2/neu or ErbB-
2). Preclinical data indicate that trastuzumab is
effective against tumor cell proliferation as long as
it is present, whereas trastuzumab withdrawal re-
sults in rapid tumor cell regrowth.1,2 In addition,
trastuzumab significantly enhances the antitumor
effect of taxanes in tumors that progress with
trastuzumab alone.3
Clinical evidence on treatment with trastu-
zumab beyond progression either alone or with a
switch to a different chemotherapy is based, so far,
on various retrospective analyses.4-7 However, these
results might be biased as a result of unknown fac-
tors that influence physicians’ decisions to stop or to
continue trastuzumab. Attempts in the United
States (ie, at The M. D. Anderson Cancer Center and
South West Oncology Group) with vinorelbine and

in Europe to investigate trastuzumab beyond progression in prospec-
tive randomized trials have failed, to date, because a strong prevision
by physicians and patients for the superiority of this approach resulted
in insufficient accrual.8
Recently, lapatinib, a small molecule that inhibits the tyrosine
kinases of HER-2 and the epidermal growth factor receptor type 1 (ie,
EGFR, HER-1, ErbB-1), in combination with capecitabine was
superior to capecitabine in patients previously treated with trastu-
zumab.9,10 It is uncertain whether this observation reflects non–cross
resistance of the two anti–HER-2 agents or represents a general syner-
gism of anti–HER-2 treatments in combination with cytotoxic agents.
Capecitabine is an oral prodrug of the antimetabolite fluororu-
racil; it is frequently used in patients with metastatic breast cancer after
taxane treatment and provides consistent response rates and accept-
able toxicity.11,12 The combination of capecitabine and trastuzumab
showed a clinical benefit rate of 63% to 70% in heavily pretreated
patients with HER-2–positive advanced breast cancer.4,13
We conducted this phase III trial to assess whether patients who
were treated with trastuzumab beyond progression and second-line
chemotherapy experienced a longer time to progression than those
treated with chemotherapy alone.
METHODS
Study Design
The German Breast Group (GBG) 26/Breast International Group
(BIG) 03-05 trial is an international, intergroup, open-label, phase III,
randomized trial. Participants were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to continue
trastuzumab with the start of capecitabine or to receive capecitabine as
single-agent therapy. Random assignment was stratified by pretreatment
(ie, taxanes and trastuzumab as adjuvant treatment, taxanes and trastu-
zumab as first-line treatment for metastatic disease, and trastuzumab alone
or in combination with cytotoxic agents other than capecitabine or taxanes
as first-line treatment) and by participating center. A random assignment
list was prepared beforehand for each stratum; a block permutation
method with a block size of 4 was used.
Time to progression was the primary end point of the trial and was
defined as the time period between random assignment and documented
disease progression or disease-related death. Response of tumor lesions was
based on investigator assessments made according to Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Because no central assessment of response
was performed, potential risk of a bias caused by the unblinded investigator
might have existed. Missing data on response evaluation were set to no re-
sponse. Clinical benefit was defined as complete response, partial response, or
disease stabilization for greater than 24 weeks. Duration of response was
defined as the time period between first notification of a response and the date
of documented progression, disease-related death, or withdrawal. Overall
survival was defined as the time period between random assignment and death
as a result of any cause. Patients who withdrew consent or who were lost to
follow-up were censored at the date of last contact. Toxicity was assessed
according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria ver-
sion 2.0.
Selection of Patients
Women with pathologically confirmed, HER-2–positive, locally ad-
vanced or metastatic breast cancer were enrolled on the study if they provided
written informed consent. HER-2 status was considered positive if overexpres-
sion was detected in either the primary or metastatic tumor tissue by local
immunohistochemistry (grade 3 staining intensity) or by fluorescence in
situ hybridization. Duration of previous trastuzumab treatment had to be 12
weeks or greater, and the time since the end of the last trastuzumab cycle had to
be less than 6 weeks. Patients could have received up to one chemotherapy
drug for metastatic disease. Patients were required to have a Karnofsky perfor-
mance status of 60% or greater; a life expectancy of greater than 3 months; and
adequate hematologic, renal, hepatic, and cardiac function that was sono-
graphically confirmed by a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50%
or greater.
Treatment
Patients received either capecitabine 2,500 mg/m2 (1,250 mg/m2 semi-
daily) on days 1 through 14 followed by 1 week of rest or the same capecitabine
regimen plus trastuzumab 6 mg/kg body weight as a 30-minute infusion every
3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. The cape-
citabine dose was rounded, because it was provided as 500-mg and 150-mg
tablets. Treatment could be delayed for up to 2 weeks to allow recovery from
acute toxicity. Trastuzumab treatment could be continued at the investigator’s
discretion while capecitabine was being withheld.
Specific recommendations for dose modification were provided for di-
arrhea of grade  2, nausea or vomiting of grade  2, skin toxicity of grade
 2, neutropenic fever, decreased LVEF to less than 45%, and other toxicities
of grade  3. Participants were assessed clinically for tumor symptoms and
toxicity and for hematology (weekly) and blood biochemistry every 3 weeks
during treatment and every 3 months thereafter. Repeat cardiac ultrasound
was performed as clinically indicated.
Statistical Methods
The time to event outcome parameters were estimated with the Kaplan-
Meier product-limit method, and the log-rank test was used to compare data
between treatment groups. For binary outcomes, the exact Fisher’s test
was used.
Sample size was calculated on the assumptions that the time to progres-
sion in the targeted population was 4 months for capecitabine alone and that
continuation of trastuzumab would result in a 27.5% improvement to 5.1
months. A one-sided significance test and a 5% type-I error, a statistical power
of 80%, and a drop-out rate of 10% were chosen, as the addition of trastu-
zumab was not expected to diminish the effect of capecitabine. An accrual
period of 24 months and a follow-up period of 12 months required the
inclusion of 482 patients.
Two interim analyses of the primary end point, scheduled after the
occurrence of 150 and 300 events, were planned. However, the first interim
analysis was performed on December 9, 2006, after accrual of 119 patients (82
events) and a follow-up of at least 3 months, at the request of the independent
data monitoring committee (IDMC) after release/publication of data on lapa-
tinib in a comparable trial setting.10 The significance level was set at .0015
according to the O’Brien-Fleming group sequential rule for three groups. The
recommendation of the IDMC was to continue patient accrual until lapatinib
became available in Europe. We subsequently performed a hypothetical sam-
ple size calculation on the basis of the results of the lapatinib study, which
revealed that the effect of lapatinib on time to progression could have been
shown with fewer than 90 patients. As accrual was slowing down, we closed the
trial in agreement with the IDMC on July 1, 2007, and we expected to reject
trastuzumab treatment beyond progression with sufficient statistical power if
the trial result was negative.
The primary analysis was performed as an intent-to-treat analysis (Fig 1).
A Cox proportional hazards model was fit to adjust for prognostic factors that
influenced time to progression. A per-protocol analysis was performed for
confirmation. All patients included in the intent-to-treat analysis were in-
cluded in the safety analysis.
Because the second interim analysis was not performed, the significance
level for the final analysis was taken at   .0467, which corresponded to a
second analysis in a two-stage O’Brian-Fleming sequence. All P values re-
ported are from two-sided tests. Because the sample size was originally calcu-
lated for a one-sided test, a corresponding one-sidedP value is also quoted for
the primary end point.
The protocol was reviewed by all responsible local ethics committees.
The conduct of the trial was supervised by an IDMC.

RESULTS
Baseline
The GBG 26 trial started in September 2003, and it was opened
subsequently in 64 centers in Germany, Austria, the Netherlands,
Slovenia, Denmark, and Great Britain. It included a total of 156 pa-
tients during the following 45 months (Fig 1). Baseline characteristics
of the 156 patients are listed in Table 1.
Previous first-line treatment for metastatic disease consisted of a
taxane-plus-trastuzumab combination in 111 patients, trastuzumab
alone or with a non–taxane-containing chemotherapy in 42 patients,
and taxane- and trastuzumab-containing adjuvant therapy in three
patients. The median durations of previous trastuzumab treatment
were 45 weeks (range, 7 to 235 weeks) in the capecitabine group
and 44 weeks (range, 10 to 284 weeks) in the capecitabine-plus-
trastuzumab group.
Compliance
A total of 586 capecitabine cycles (median per patient, 6;
range, 1 to 42) were administered in the capecitabine group; 819
capecitabine cycles (median per patient, 9; range, 1 to 39) and 934
trastuzumab cycles (median per patient, 9; range, 1 to 60) were
administered in the capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group. Day 1
of a capecitabine cycle was delayed for 3 or more days in 125 cycles
(23.7%) in the capecitabine group and in 82 cycles (11.3%) in the
capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group. Treatment interruptions
occurred in 42 cycles (8.0%) in the capecitabine group and in 74
cycles (9.3%) in the capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group. A
dose reduction of capecitabine became necessary in 43 patients
(58.9%) in the capecitabine group and in 43 patients (57.3%) in
the capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group. Trastuzumab was de-
layed for 3 or more days in 64 cycles (7.5%); no dose reduction
was performed.
Overall, six patients received lapatinib as subsequent medication
(two patients from the X arm and four patients from the capecitabine/
trastuzumab [XH] arm).
Efficacy
During a median follow-up of 15.6 months, 65 events occurred
in the capecitabine group, and 62 events occurred in the capecitabine-
plus-trastuzumab group. The median time to progressions of the
intent-to-treat analysis were 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.2 to 6.3) in
the capecitabine group and 8.2 months (95% CI, 7.3 to 11.2) in the
capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; two-
sided log-rankP .0338; one-sidedP .0169; Fig 2A). In a sensitivity
analysis that excluded three patients who had no prior chemotherapy,
one patient who had no protocol-specified documentation of positive
HER-2 status, and one patient who had no documentation of
protocol-specified tumor lesions, the hazard ratio was 0.65 (two-sided
log-rank P  .0164; one-sided P  .0082). The adjusted HR of the
multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was 0.66 (P  .049).
Other significant prognostic factors that influenced time to progres-
sion were positive estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor
(PgR) status and a low-risk metastatic site (Table 2).
Response to treatment was assessed in 68 patients (91.9%)
of the capecitabine group and in 75 patients (97.4%) in the
capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group. A complete or partial re-
sponse was reported in 20 patients (27.0%; 95% exact CI, 17.4 to
38.6) in the capecitabine group and in 37 patients (48.1%; 95%
exact CI, 36.5 to 59.7) in the capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group
(odds ratio, 2.50; P  .0115). An additional 20 patients in the
capecitabine group and 21 patients in the capecitabine-plus-
trastuzumab group had stable disease for greater than 24 weeks,
which resulted in clinical benefit rates of 54.1% (95% exact CI, 42.1
to 65.7) in the capecitabine group and 75.3% (95% exact CI, 64.2 to
84.4) in the capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group (odds ratio,
2.59; P .0068). Durations of response were 3.4 months (95% CI,
3.0 to 5.9) in the capecitabine group and 3.9 months (95% CI, 1.8

patients (13.8%) in the capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group de-
veloped metastases to the central nervous system.
A total of 38 deaths occurred in the capecitabine group, and 33
deaths occurred in the capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group. The
median overall survival times were 20.4 months (95% CI, 17.8 to 24.7)
in the capecitabine alone group and 25.5 months (95% CI, 19.0 to
30.7) in the capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group (HR, 0.76; two-
sided P .2570; one-sided P .13; Fig 2B).
Safety
A total of 49 patients (66.2%) in 81 (13.8%) cycles in the capecit-
abine group and 49 patients (63.6%) in 95 (10.2%) cycles in the
capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group experienced grade 3 or 4 toxic-

DISCUSSION
The introduction of trastuzumab has improved the prognosis of
women with HER-2–positive metastatic breast cancer beyond that of
women with HER-2–negative disease.14 Consequently, subsequent
lines of treatment are more frequently required. This GBG 26/BIG 03-
05 study demonstrates that continued treatment with trastuzumab
beyond progression improves activity of subsequent chemotherapy in
patients with HER-2–positive breast cancer.
Continued response to therapy in the face of treatment failure is
something of a paradox. Most anticancer drugs work predominantly
through an antiproliferative effect. Trastuzumab clearly demon-
strates such an antiproliferative effect that is mediated through
inhibition of HER-2 signaling in preclinical models.2 This leads to
alterations in cell cycle regulators,15 reduced activity of DNA repair
pathways,2,16 and HER-2–mediated antiangiogenic activity.17 How-
ever, the chemotherapy-sensitizing mechanism of trastuzumab1,2
likely depends on specific capabilities of monoclonal antibodies. Tras-
tuzumab can induce an immune-mediated, target-cell killing by
antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity.2,18-20 Our hypothe-
sis is that, under the selective pressure of continuous antibody expo-
sure, breast cancer cells are able to bypass the antiproliferative action
of trastuzumab but leave a chemotherapy-sensitizing mechanism in-
tact. Recent data suggest that reintroduction or continuation of tras-
tuzumab improves even the efficacy of other noncytotoxic drugs, like
lapatinib, pertuzumab, tenispimycin, or DM1, in patients with meta-
static breast cancer who are heavily pretreated.21
When our results are compared with the trial of lapatinib and
capecitabine,9,10 some differences in the trial designs should be con-
sidered. Whereas 38% of patients had a trastuzumab-free interval of
greater than 8 weeks in the lapatinib trial, all patients had to continue
trastuzumab within 6 weeks of the last infusion in our trial. More than
one chemotherapy drug for metastatic disease was allowed in the
lapatinib trial, whereas, in our trial, the vast majority of the patients
started capecitabine as second-line chemotherapy for metastatic dis-
ease. This might explain the shorter time to progression in the
capecitabine-alone group in the lapatinib trial (4.4 months)9 com-
pared with the time in our trial (5.6 months). When the benefits and
risks of both approaches are evaluated, HRs from the assessment by
investigators should be compared (0.72 for lapatinib and 0.71 for
trastuzumab).22 The addition of lapatinib to capecitabine was associ-
ated with more diarrhea and rash10; the addition of trastuzumab did
not add clinically relevant toxicity (Table 3). Nevertheless, this as-
sumption is based on a comparison of events, is not adjusted to the
different patient populations, and could only be confirmed by a direct
comparison in a controlled clinical trial.
Our trial has several strengths and limitations. The results con-
sistently show superior efficacy of continuation of trastuzumab in the
adjusted and sensitivity analyses. The trial investigated in a straight-
forward, prospective way the beyond-progression approach, as all
patients progressed during trastuzumab treatment. Patients in the

Fig 2. Kaplan-Meier estimates of disease progression or (A) disease-related
death and (B) death. In the capecitabine group, the median time to progression
was 5.64 months (range, 4.16 to 6.30 months); 65 events occurred, and nine
patients were censored because of incomplete follow-up. The median duration of
overall survival was 20.39 months (range, 17.77 to 24.66 months); 38 events
occurred, and 36 patients were censored because of incomplete follow-up. In the
capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group, the median time to progression was 8.16
months (range, 7.25 to 11.21 months); 62 events occurred, and 15 patients were
censored because of incomplete follow-up. The median duration of overall
survival was 25.48 months (range, 19.02 to 30.69 months); 33 events occurred,
and 44 patients were censored because of incomplete follow-up. The unadjusted
hazard ratios from the intent-to-treat population were 0.685 (95% CI, 0.482 to
0.974; two-sided log-rank P  .0338; one-sided log-rank P  .0169) for time to
progression and 0.763 (95% CI, 0.477 to 1.220; two-sided log-rank P .2570) for
overall survival.

capecitabine group probably had an ongoing exposure to trastu-
zumab because of the drug’s long half-life.23 This is supported by
the shape of the curves (Fig 2A) for time to progression, which does
not separate for the first 3 months, and by the overall response rate that
is higher than those reported previously for capecitabine alone.11,12
Also, a potential bias in assessment of response rates by the unblinded
investigator can not be excluded.
Because of premature closure of the trial, the number of patients
included in the trial is small; however, it is the only trial worldwide, to
our knowledge, that reached a sufficient sample size for statistical
analysis. Currently active trials either will compare trastuzumab with
lapatinib directly or with a combination of lapatinib and trastuzumab,
so the genuine activity of trastuzumab beyond progression will not be
assessed again.
In vitro laboratory experiments did not identify fluorouracil as
additive or synergistic with trastuzumab.24 However, in-tumor xeno-
graft models of capecitabine and trastuzumab had at least additive
antitumor activity in vivo.25 One might speculate that trastuzumab
beyond progression will be even more efficacious with other chemo-
therapeutic drugs, like platinum compounds.26
In conclusion, these data confirm a statistically and clinically
significant improved response and time to progression for the
continuation of trastuzumab beyond progression in the manage-
ment of women with HER-2–positive advanced breast cancer. So far,
