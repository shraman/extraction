The Acute Effects of a Rollator in Individuals With COPD Renu Gupta, MSc; Roger Goldstein, FRCP (C); Dina Brooks, PhD ................................................................................................................................................................................................................. h PURPOSE: To investigate whether the acute benefits of rollator use are consistent over time in individuals with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
h METHODS: Thirty-one stable subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (13 men, 18 women), aged 68 T 8 years, with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 0.7 T 0.2 L (33% T 12% predicted) and a baseline 6-minute walk (6MW) of 261 T 68 m, were recruited from a respiratory clinic after completion of a pulmonary rehabilitation program.
Two 6MWs were performed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks, one walking unaided and the other walking with the assistance of a rollator.
The test order was randomly chosen at baseline, and the same test order was used at each time point.
The primary outcome measures were distance walked in 6 minutes (meters), perceived dyspnea using a modified Borg scale, and number of rests taken.
h RESULTS: Subjects achieved higher 6MW distances during assisted compared with unassisted walking at baseline (292 T 67 vs 263 T 67 m), 4 weeks (296 T 62 vs 275 T 63m), and 8 weeks (283 T 65 vs 259 T 68 m) (P = .013), with no time effect (P = .5).
In addition, use of a rollator resulted in a significant improvement in dyspnea (P = .004) at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks, with no time effect (P = .7).
The use of a rollator also reduced the number of rests taken during the 6MW (P G .001), with no time effect (P = .9).
h CONCLUSIONS: Rollator use resulted in improvements in performance in the 6MW, which were consistent over time among individuals with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who walk less than 375 m during an unaided 6MW.
INTRODUCTION .............................................................................................................
Among individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), walking is an important, useful, and preferred form of exercise.1 Therefore, most pulmonary rehabilitation programs include walking both as part of their exercise training program and as a way of evaluating functional exercise capacity.2,3 In COPD, dyspnea is the cardinal symptom that limits exercise.4 Consequently, many approaches to the management of patients with COPD, such as the prescription of bronchodilators, are aimed at relieving dyspnea.
In addition, dyspnea may be reduced through nonphar- macologic approaches such as using a rollator to pro- vide mechanical assistance during walking.
A rollator is a walker with 4 wheels, equipped with swivel castors in the front 2 wheels, hand brakes, a basket for carrying objects, and a seat that allows the user to rest.5 Several prior reports have noted that rollator use is associated with a reduction in dyspnea and an increase in functional exercise capacity.6Y12 There are a variety of mechanisms by which the rollator assists walking, K E Y W O R D S COPD functional exercise capacity pulmonary rehabilitation rollator walk test From the Graduate Department of Rehabilitation Science (Ms Gupta and Dr Brooks), Departments of Physical Therapy (Dr Goldstein and Dr Brooks), and Medicine (Dr Goldstein), University of Toronto; West Park HealthCare Centre (Dr Goldstein and Dr Brooks), Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

including repositioning the body forward to an improved biomechanical position, stabilizing the arms and upper ribcage to enable the respiratory muscles to make greater contributions to respiration, transferring some of the patient’s weight to the rollator, and improving pacing and walking efficiency.7Y12 How- ever, not all patients benefit from a rollator.
Patients whose walking is the most compromised seem more likely to benefit compared with those with modest impairment.8,10,11 Until recently, formal evaluation of the effectiveness of a rollator was uncommon.
For example, in Ontario, Canada (population, 10 million), in the years 2003 to 2004, approximately 5,000 walking aids were funded for adults with respiratory diagnoses at a cost of CDN$1.5 million (Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, Assistive Devices Program, Wheelchair Positioning and Ambulation Aids Category, personal communication, 2005).
These aids were funded based on an assessment by a healthcare professional, usually an occupational therapist or a physiotherapist, with no requirement for submission of any standardized evi- dence of effectiveness.
More recently, it has become customary in some pulmonary rehabilitation programs to request that the patient undergo two 6-minute walks (6MWs), supervised by a member of the healthcare team, one with a rollator and the other without a rollator.
Distance walked, dyspnea scores, and the number of rests in 6 minutes are recorded to ascertain whether walking with the rollator resulted in improved function.
In a recent study, the results of paired 6MW among patients with severe COPD showed that for impaired patients with reduced walking ability, the rollator in- creased their 6MW from 220 T 12 to 242 T 14 m (P = .02), with shorter rest time and less dyspnea compared with walking unaided.11 An outstanding issue with regard to testing for the effectiveness of a rollator is whether the results of a single pair of 6MW tests are sufficient.
Concern regarding this issue has resulted in patients being required to undergo repeated testing of effective- ness, often at the time of their first follow-up.
To date, no studies have provided information as to whether the acute effects of walking with a rollator remain consis- tent over time.
In this report, we evaluated whether the acute effects of walking with a rollator remained con- sistent after 1 and 2 months, among individuals with moderate to severe COPD.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS .............................................................................................................
Participants Subjects were recruited after completion of a pulmonary rehabilitation program.
Subjects were approached if they met the following inclusion criteria: clinical stability, a diagnosis of moderate to severe COPD4 (a forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity ratio of G0.7 and a forced expiratory volume in 1 second of G59%), no previously prescribed walking aid, unaided 6MW of G375 m, and completed a pulmonary rehabilitation program.
This last criterion meant that all subjects were experienced in the 6MW, having per- formed this test on several occasions as part of their rehabilitation program.
Exclusion criteria were as fol- lows: comorbidities that influenced either exercise tolerance or sensation of dyspnea, inability to complete a 6MW, and inability to communicate sufficiently well to follow the study protocol.
Protocol The study was approved by the affiliated university and healthcare research ethics committees.
Written informed consent was provided by all subjects.
A repeated mea- sures study design was used, with each subject being studied at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks.
Subjects were requested to abstain from vigorous exercise and caffeine for 4 hours prior to the session and to follow their usual bronchodilator regimen on the day of their scheduled appointment.
Subjects were requested to wear the same comfortable footwear at every measure- ment session.
Two 6MW tests were performed with a minimum of 1 hour rest between the tests.
One 6MW test was performed unaided, and the other was performed using a rollator (Opal Legacy; Dolomite, Markham, Ontario, Canada), the test order being randomly decided at baseline and then followed for each pair of tests.
The 6MW was performed in a quiet corridor of 30 m, with pylons at the beginning and end of the course and a chair placed halfway.13 All subjects were familiar with the 6MW test and had performed at least 2 practice walks before data collection to control for learning effects.14 Standard- ized instructions and encouragement were provided as per guidelines of the American Thoracic Society.13 Encouragement was provided by the tester at every minute.
Subjects were requested to cover as much ground as possible during the test period, stopping only when they felt too tired or breathless to continue, and to resume walking as soon as they were able to do so.
The tester accompanied the subjects for both walks but walked behind the subject to avoid pacing.
The height of the rollator was standardized by ensuring that the height of the rollator handles was at the level of the subject’s ulnar styloid process.15 This position was maintained consistently during all tests.
Subjects who used supplemental oxygen for walking completed their unaided test with the oxygen unit being pulled in an oxygen stroller or trolley and their aided test, with their portable oxygen unit in the rollator basket.

Measures For each 6MW test, the distance walked (meters) and the number of rests taken during the test were recorded.
Perceived dyspnea (difficulty of breathing) was rated before and after the test using a modified Borg scale consisting of numbers 0 to 10 anchored by descriptive phrases.
This scale is widely used to evaluate dyspnea during exercise.16,17 After completing both tests, sub- jects were asked to complete a standardized preference questionnaire to indicate whether they preferred walk- ing with the rollator and to provide the reasons for their preference.11 Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistics and frequencies were tabulated for subject characteristics and preferences.
Differences for outcomes with and without the rollator over time were analyzed using a 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance with 2 factors: use of rollator versus nonrollator and time (baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks).
To deter- mine whether the difference between aided and unaided walking was consistent at each time point, a 1-factor repeated-measures analysis of variance was conducted.
To determine if the difference between aided and un- aided walking was dependent on the baseline 6MW distance, a linear regression analysis was conducted.
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 11.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill) statistical software, with significance being defined as P G .05.
RESULTS ............................................................................................................. Thirty-five individuals with a medical diagnosis of COPD were recruited for this study, with 31 individ- uals completing the study.
One patient died of non- respiratory cause, and 3 were lost to follow-up despite repeated effort.
The baseline characteristics of these subjects are summarized in Table 1.
The mean distance walked in 6 minutes using the rollator (assisted walk- ing) and unassisted walking at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks for all subjects is shown in Figure 1.
There was an improvement in the distance walked with respect to rollator use (F = 6.3; P = .013).
Subjects achieved a higher 6MW distance during assisted walking compared with unassisted walking at baseline (292 T 67 vs 263 T 67 m), 4 weeks (296 T 62 vs 275 T 63m), and 8 weeks (283 T 65 vs 259 T 68 m).
There was no difference in the changes observed over time (P = .45).
The use of the rollator resulted in a significant reduction in the perception of dyspnea (F = 8.401; P = .004).
This pattern was observed at baseline (3.7 T 1.5 vs 4.6 T 1.5 m), 4 weeks (4.0 T 1.9 vs 4.5 T 1.6), and 8 weeks (3.7 T 1.6 vs 4.4 T 1.5) (Figure 2).
There was no difference in the changes observed over time (P = .7).
The use of a rollator resulted in significantly fewer rests (F = 22.33; P G .001) compared with unassisted walking (Figure 3).
There was no difference in the changes observed, over time (P = .9).
The difference between assisted and unassisted walking versus the baseline unassisted 6MW was not significant (r = 0.3, P = .9).
Eighty-eight percent of the subjects preferred walk- ing with the rollator during the 6MW at baseline, 93% at 4 weeks, and 89% at 8 weeks (Table 2).
DISCUSSION .............................................................................................................
In this study, we note that the improvement in walking performance with a rollator was consistent over time among individuals with moderate to severe COPD who had limited baseline functional exercise capacity.
These improvements applied to total distance walked, dyspnea ratings, and the number of rests taken during the walk .............................................................................................................

test.
The improvements did not correlate with the subjects’ baseline functional exercise capacity.
These observations extend the findings of previous studies that have evaluated the acute effects of rollator use among individuals with COPD,9Y12 always at a single time point.
Probst et al12 noted improvements of 27 m among subjects who walked 416 m unaided, and Solway et al11 noted improvements of 22 m among subjects who walked less than 300 m unaided.
Other reports8,10 in which unaided walking was impaired showed improvements similar to those reported by Solway et al.
In this study, the improvement of 28, 20, and 24 m at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks, respec- tively, were consistent with previous reports in an impaired population with moderate to severe COPD (a forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 33% T 12%).
Most subjects (88% at baseline, 93% at 4 weeks, 89% at 8 weeks) preferred walking with the rollator and reported that it enabled them to breathe easier and to feel safer during ambulation.
The reduction in dyspnea was also consistent with studies in a similarly impaired COPD population.
Study limitations included the absence of blinding of patients or tester.
Lack of blinding can influence the findings, especially if they are marginal.14,17 However, walking distance was automated, and a standardized protocol was used for the variables collected manually.
Another study limitation was that walking tests were conducted in an artificial environment and therefore may not accurately have reflected day-to-day life.
However, performance on the 6MW has been shown to closely parallel the level of activity that individuals are likely to perform in their daily lives.18 In Ontario, Canada, the number of ambulation aids funded between 1999 and 2004 has remained quite consistent, between 19,400 and 22,900, of which 73% to 87% were for those aged over 65 years, and of these 25% had respiratory diagnoses (Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care, Assistive Devices Program, .............................................................................................................

Thus, rollators are a large cost for the healthcare system.
This study demon- strated that among patients with moderate to severe COPD who have impaired walking ability, rollators improved walking distance, reduced rest time, and decreased dyspnea, observations that remained con- sistent over time.
Future studies will need to address ways to facilitate and streamline rollator prescription among individuals with COPD.
