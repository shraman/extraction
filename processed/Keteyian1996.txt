Rogers, DO; John R. Schairer, DO; Paul D. Stein, MD; T. Barry Levine, MD;  and Sidney Goldstein, MD  Objective: To assess the benefit of exercise training in  patients with heart failure caused by left ventricular sys- tolic dysfunction and to further describe the physiologic  changes associated with exercise training in these patients.
Design: Randomized, controlled trial.
Setting: Urban outpatient clinic.
Patients: 40 men with compensated heart failure who  were receiving standard medical therapy were randomly  assigned to an exercise-training group or to a control  group that did not exercise.
Fifteen of the 21 patients  assigned to exercise training and 14 of the 19 patients  assigned to the control group completed the study.
Intervention: Patients assigned to exercise training par- ticipated in a program of three exercise sessions per week  for 24 weeks.
Measurements: Symptom-limited exercise tests with gas  exchange analysis done just before randomization, at  week 12f and at week 24.
Results: At week 24f the following changes (mean ± SE)  were seen in patients in the exercise group and patients in  the control group, respectively: exercise duration,  2.8 ± 0.6 minutes and 0.5 ± 0.5 minutes; peak oxygen con- sumption (V02), 231 ± 54 L/min and 58 ± 38 Lymin; peak  ventilation, 12 ± 3 L/min and - 4 ± 3 L/min; peak heart  rate, 10 ± 4 beats/min and - 2 ± 4 beats/min; and peak  power output, 20 ± 6 W and 2 ± 5 W. Differences be- tween the increases occurring in the exercise group and  the changes occurring in the control group were signifi- cant (P < 0.05).
Among patients in the exercise group,  85% of the increase in peak V02 occurred by week 12, and  46% of the increase in peak V02 was caused by the in- crease in peak heart rate.
Conclusions: Exercise training does not appear to be  contraindicated in patients with compensated heart fail- ure.
Exercise training improved exercise tolerance, as mea- sured by increases in peak V02, exercise duration, and  power output.
This improved exercise tolerance was  caused in part by an increase in peak heart rate.

The role of exercise training in the treatment of heart failure remains a paradox, because exer- cise intolerance is a characteristic finding in patients  with this condition.
Improved exercise performance  after exercise training has been seen in patients with  heart failure, but such training is not yet widely  incorporated into clinical practice.
In addition, the  mechanisms by which this improvement occurs are  uncertain.
Factors that may explain the improve- ment include an increase in cardiac output (1, 2), an  improvement in skeletal muscle metabolism (3-5),  and an increase in peak blood flow to the exercising  limb that is caused by a decrease in vascular resis- tance (1, 2, 5).
Five randomized trials (5-9) have assessed exer- cise performance after exercise training in patients  with symptomatic heart failure.
Two trials that as- sessed cardiorespiratory fitness as measured by ox- ygen consumption (V02) showed a 22% improve- ment in peak V02 after 4 weeks of exercise training  (6) and a 31% improvement after 6 months of  exercise training (5).
Two other trials (7, 8) showed  an increase in exercise duration after 12 weeks of  exercise training, and a fifth trial (9) recently found  no significant increase in peak V02 after exercise  training.
We sought to assess the benefit of exercise train- ing in patients with heart failure caused by left  ventricular systolic dysfunction and to further de- scribe the physiologic changes associated with exer- cise training.
Functional capacity and cardiorespira- tory fitness were measured before and after exercise  training in patients with compensated heart failure  who were receiving standard medical therapy.
Pa- tients were randomly assigned either to a group that  participated in a program of three supervised exer- cise sessions per week for 24 weeks (exercise group)  or to a control group that did not exercise.
Methods  Patients  Forty men with compensated heart failure and  left ventricular dysfunction were randomly assigned  to the exercise group (n = 21) or the control group  (n = 19).
Randomization was done according to a  © 1996 American College of Physicians 1051  Downloaded From: http://annals.org/ by a The Indian Inst of Tech Kharagpur User  on 10/28/2015 computer-generated randomization list.
Patients were  recruited from the outpatient heart failure clinic of a  tertiary care hospital or from the office of a cardi- ologist practicing in the community.
Patients meet- ing the eligibility criteria for the study first received  a brief explanation of the study from their cardiol- ogist.
Patients willing to participate in the random- ized trial were then referred.
The hospital's institu- tional review board approved our study, and all  patients provided written informed consent.
Inclusion criteria were New York Heart Associ- ation class II or III, a resting ejection fraction of  35% or less as measured by echocardiography or  gated equilibrium radionuclide angiography, and no  change in medical therapy for 30 days before ran- domization.
Exclusion criteria were atrial fibrilla- tion, acute myocardial infarction within the previous  3 months, angina pectoris at rest or induced by  exercise, current enrollment in another clinical trial,  and current participation in a regular exercise pro- gram (at least twice weekly).
Patients were classified  as having ischemic cardiomyopathy if they had had  a myocardial infarction or had angiographic evi- dence of coronary artery disease that could explain  the extent of ventricular dysfunction.
If they did not  meet these criteria, they were classified as having  idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
Study Design  Exercise tests were completed before and after a  30-day prestudy period.
The prestudy period was  used to document the stability of exercise tolerance,  clinical conditions, and prescribed medications.
Im- mediately after completing the second exercise test,  patients were randomly assigned to the exercise  group or the control group.
Each patient's assign- ment was sealed in an envelope until completion of  the second exercise test.
Exercise testing was re- peated at weeks 12 and 24 for patients in both  groups.
Each patient's physician was asked not to  change a patient's drug regimen during the study, if  possible.
Patients in the control group were in- structed to maintain their normal daily activity hab- its and not to begin an exercise regimen.
Controls  were contacted by telephone every 2 to 3 weeks to  assess compliance, cardiac-related symptoms, and  continued avoidance of a regular activity program.
Exercise Testing  Symptom-limited, maximal exercise tests were com- pleted using an upright stationary cycle ergometer  (Monark, Stockholm, Sweden), starting at a power  output of 25 W and increasing by 25 W every 3  minutes.
Tests were discontinued when dyspnea or  calf, thigh, or generalized fatigue developed.
Pa- tients were monitored by electrocardiography (Q- 3000, Quinton Instruments, Seattle, Washington) at  rest, during exercise, and during 8 minutes of re- covery.
Blood pressure, heart rate, rating of per- ceived exertion (categorized on the Borg scale;  range, 6 to 20), and a 12-lead electrocardiogram  were obtained after 30 minutes of supine rest,  within the last 25 seconds of each stage of exercise,  and during peak exercise.
Air expired during exercise testing was analyzed  using a Horizon II Metabolic System (Sensormedics,  Yorba Linda, California).
Direct measurement and  calculations were used to determine peak V02, car- bon dioxide production (VC02), ventilation, oxygen  (02) pulse, and respiratory exchange ratio.
Expired  air was sampled at a rate of 10 per second and  reported as a 15-second average.
Exercise tests in  the exercise group and the control group represented  peak effort, as evidenced by ratings of perceived  exertion that were generally 16 or more and respi- ratory exchange ratios that were greater than 1.1.
Ventilatory derived anaerobic threshold (V-AT)  was determined using the V-slope method, origi- nally defined by Beaver and colleagues (10) and  later simplified by others (11-13).
This measure, in  which VC02 is plotted as a function of V02, can be  used to detect the beginning of excess carbon diox- ide production caused by the buffering of H+ that  arise from lactic acid.
Two independent, experi- enced reviewers blinded to the patients' group as- signment and testing periods determined V-AT.
For  four patients in the exercise group and five patients  in the control group, a reviewer could not deter- mine V-AT in at least one of each patient's three  exercise tests.
We also computed the slope of the  relation between ventilation and VC02 as a marker  of the severity of heart failure (14).
Exercise Training  Each exercise training session lasted 43 minutes.
During each session, patients completed a 5-minute,  slow warm-up phase, a 33-minute aerobic phase  (three different types of exercise equipment were  used for 11 minutes each), and a 5-minute cool- down phase.
Exercise equipment included motor- driven treadmills, stationary cycles, rowing ma- chines, and arm ergometers.
Patients attended the  exercise training program three times per week.
Us- ing the heart rate reserve method (15), we set ex- ercise intensity at 60% for the first 2 weeks and  then increased it, as tolerated, to as high as 80%.
A  rating of perceived exertion of 12 to 14 was also  used to guide exercise intensity.
Heart rate and  rhythm were monitored during exercise using a sin- gle-lead electrocardiography telemetry system.

weeks 12 and 24 were considered in the data analy- sis.
The 5 patients who dropped out for nonmedical  reasons were asked to return for follow-up testing,  but they refused.
We compared patient characteris- tics at baseline using an unpaired Mest or the  Fisher exact test.
We used univariate repeated-mea- sures analysis of variance with the Greenhouse-Geis- ser (16) sphericity correction to determine whether  a significant (P < 0.05) difference in the change  across time occurred between the two groups.
For  variables for which a significant (or a tendency to- ward a significant) time-group interaction was de- tected, we used analysis of variance to assess a  within-group time effect and used a Student two- sample Mest to assess a group effect.
For the latter  two analyses, we used the Bonferroni multiple test- ing adjustment to reduce the a level accordingly.

The SAS software  package (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) was  used for all analyses.
Results  Compliance, Medical Therapy, and Safety  Among patients who completed the study, no  differences in demographic characteristics were seen  between the two study groups after randomization  (Table 1).
Of the 40 patients randomly assigned at  baseline, 29 completed the study and 11 dropped  out (Table 1).
Regardless of the reason for drop  out, patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy tended  to drop out more frequently (7 of 16 patients [44%])  than did patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (4 of  24 patients [17%]) (P = 0.08).
In addition, ejection  fraction tended to be lower in patients who dropped  out than in those who did not (18% ± 5% com- pared with 23% ± 8%; P = 0.09), and patients who  dropped out tended to be older (61 ± 10 years com- pared with 54 ± 11 years; P = 0.07).
No differences  were seen in New York Heart Association class (II  compared with III) between patients who completed  the study and those who dropped out.
Fifteen patients in the exercise group completed  the study.
Two patients dropped out because of  noncardiac medical conditions (progressive, limiting  arthritis in one patient and newly diagnosed cancer  in the other) that developed within 1 month of the  start of the exercise program.
One patient devel- oped atrial fibrillation between week 12 and week  24; 3 other patients stopped exercising for personal  reasons before week 12 and refused follow-up test- ing.
Fourteen of the 19 patients in the control group  completed the study.
Two dropped out for personal  reasons and refused follow-up testing, 1 developed  atrial fibrillation between week 12 and week 24, 1  was hospitalized at week 22 for an acute myocardial  infarction, and 1 died suddenly.
At baseline, the drug regimens of the exercise  and control groups were similar (Table 1); drugs  included digoxin, diuretics, and an angiotensin II- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.

week study, minor changes in medications occured  among patients in the exercise group.
In three pa- tients, the dose of an ACE inhibitor was increased;  in two, the dose of a long-acting nitrate was in- creased; in three, the dose of a diuretic agent was  changed; and in one, digoxin therapy was stopped.
In two controls, the dose of an ACE inhibitor was  decreased; in one, the ACE inhibitor dose was in- creased; and in one, digoxin therapy was discontin- ued.
No patients began receiving an ACE inhibitor,  a diuretic agent, or a long-acting nitrate during the  study.

the first 12 weeks, but between weeks 12 and 24, the  patient attended 30% of exercise sessions.
In this  patient, however, peak V02 increased by more than  20%.
All 14 controls who completed the study re- ported avoiding participation in any regular physical  activity program during the 24-week study.
Overall,  138 symptom-limited graded exercise tests and 1150  exercise training sessions were completed without  incident.
Rest and Submaximal Exercise  No significant differences over time were seen  between the exercise and control groups in resting  heart rate, heart rate during exercise at 50 W, ven- tilation at 50 W, or resting systolic or diastolic blood  pressures.
Among patients in the exercise group, the  heart rate during exercise at a standardized sub- maximal power output of 50 W was significantly  decreased over time (—8 ± 3 beats/min; P = 0.025).
A similar decrease was not seen in the control  group (0 ± 3 beats/min; P > 0.2).
Peak Exercise  Four measures of exercise tolerance—absolute  peak V02 (P < 0.05), relative peak V02 (P < 0.05),  exercise duration (P < 0.01), and peak power out- put (P < 0.05)—were significantly increased over  time in the patient group compared with the control  group (Table 2; Figures 1 and 2).
No significant  difference in V-AT over time was seen between the  two groups.
Among patients in the exercise group,  absolute peak V02 and peak V02 relative to body  mass increased over time by 16.3% and 15.6%, re- spectively.
Age tended to be related to the observed  1054 15 June 1996 • Annals of Internal Medicine • Volume 124 • Number 12  Downloaded From: http://annals.org/ by a The Indian Inst of Tech Kharagpur User  on 10/28/2015 change in peak V02 (r = -0.49; P= 0.08), and  85% of the increase in peak V02 occurred by week  12.
Among patients in the control group, absolute  and relative peak V02 changed by 4.7% and 3.5%,  respectively.
Among patients in the exercise group, the in- crease in peak V02 tended to be greater in those  with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (305 ± 60  mL/min) than in those with ischemic cardiomyopa- thy (121 ± 67 mL/min) (P = 0.07).
No other differ- ences were seen among patients in the exercise  group, relative to the etiology of heart failure.
The difference in the change in peak ventilation  over time between patients in the exercise group  and patients in the control group was significant  (P < 0.01).
However, the change in the slope for  ventilation to VC02 over time did not differ be- tween groups (exercise group, -1.3 ± 0.9; control  group, -2.2 ± 1.0).
Peak ventilation increased by  12 ± 3 L/min in the exercise group (P = 0.001) and  decreased by 4 ± 3 L/min in the control group (P =  0.2).
In addition, a significant difference (P < 0.05)  was seen in the change over time in peak heart rate  between the exercise group (132 ± 6 beats/min to  142 ± 5 beats/min; difference, 10 ± 4 beats/min) and  the control group (136 ± 7 beats/min to 135 ± 8  beats/min; difference, - 2 ± 4 beats/min) (Figure 3).
Peak rate pressure product, 0 2 pulse, rating of per- ceived exertion, respiratory exchange ratio, and sys- tolic and diastolic blood pressures did not signifi- cantly differ between groups.
Discussion  In this randomized trial, we showed that moder- ately to vigorously intense exercise training safely  improved exercise capacity in patients with compen- sated heart failure and left ventricular systolic dys- function.
Our observations of improved exercise du- ration, power output, and V02 after 24 weeks of  exercise training are consistent with findings of pre- vious uncontrolled (1, 17) or crossover (2, 18) trials  involving similar types of patients.
The 16% im- provement in V02 that we found is also consistent  with the 22% increase reported by Jette and col- leagues (6) but is less than the 31% increase re- ported by Hambrecht and coworkers (5).
In our  exercise group, 85% of the improvement in peak  V02 had occurred by week 12.
Chronotropic incompetence is characteristic of  patients with heart failure, and peak heart rate is a  determinant of exercise capacity (19).
Our study  suggests that chronotropic incompetence may be re- versed, in part, by exercise training.
This finding  differs from those in previous reports, which showed  Figure 2.

no change in peak heart rate after exercise training  (1, 5, 20).
In fact, increased peak heart rate ac- counted for 46% of the increase in peak V02 that  occurred in the exercise group.
We did not differ- entiate, however, between an increase in peak heart  rate caused by a physiologic adaptation (such as a  change in px receptor sensitivity) and an increase  caused by an improved ability on the part of the  exercise-trained patients to put forth greater effort.
The absence of any differences between groups for  rating of perceived exertion and respiratory ex- change ratio (see Table 2) suggests that the increase  in peak heart rate was probably not caused by an  improved ability on the part of exercise-trained pa- tients to put forth greater effort during testing.
We  have previously reported (21) a similar degree of  heart rate-related improvement in exercise perfor- Figure 3.

The increased  peak heart rate in such patients was thought to  reflect a training-induced strengthening of the skel- etal muscles of the legs, which allowed the patients  to continue cycle testing until they reached a higher  peak heart rate.
Not all of the increase in peak V02 can be  explained by the increase in peak heart rate.
Sulli- van and colleagues (1) reported a trend toward an  increased stroke volume at peak exercise after train- ing that was accompanied by an increased peak  single-leg blood flow and a trend toward an in- creased leg arteriovenous 0 2 difference.
An increase  in peak cardiac output (2, 5) and a decrease in both  systemic vascular resistance (5) and plasma norepi- nephrine levels (2) have been reported after exer- cise training.
These changes were associated with an  increase in vagal tone, which is presumed to be a  result of a correction of the autonomic imbalance  that is known to be present in patients with heart  failure (2).
Abnormal skeletal muscle function and metabo- lism have also been implicated as a cause of exer- cise intolerance in patients with heart failure (22- 24).
Although additional evidence assessing the  effects of exercise training on skeletal muscle me- tabolism is needed, training may improve oxidative  capacity (5) and muscle energetics during submaxi- mal exercise (3, 4, 25).
Peak ventilation, power output, and exercise du- ration also improved in our exercise group.
Exercise  duration is often used as a measure in clinical trials  to evaluate the efficacy of certain drugs.
Although  exercise duration may not be a valid marker of  exercise capacity (26, 27), our exercise group did  show more than a 2-minute increase compared with  the control group.
This increase in exercise duration  exceeds the 0.5- to 1.5-minute increases that have  been previously shown in clinical trials evaluating  ACE inhibitors (18, 28) or digoxin (7, 28).
The absence of a significant improvement in ab- solute V-AT over time in our exercise group com- pared with controls differs from the findings of the  one randomized trial that has assessed this variable  in patients with heart failure (5).
Hambrecht and  colleagues (5) showed a 23% increase in absolute  V-AT after 6 months of exercise training.
Improved  function during submaximal exercise is clearly an  important consideration in these patients, who often  have symptoms of exercise intolerance.
Their ability  to do standard or routine daily activities with fewer  or less severe symptoms and a reduced heart rate  response is a useful and functional outcome.
Previ- ous investigators have shown that in patients with  heart failure, improved exercise capacity is associ- ated with improved New York Heart Association  class (20), quality-of-life scores (7), and patient- scored symptoms of breathlessness or fatigue (2).
Our study had some limitations.
Randomization  was done after patients completed the exercise test  at the end of the 30-day prestudy period.
Therefore,  persons conducting the exercise tests at weeks 12  and 24 were aware of group assignment.
Bias at  these times was possible but unlikely, because an  effort was made to have all patients exercise to their  peak effort.
Evidence that peak effort was achieved is found  in both the rating of perceived exertion and the  respiratory exchange ratio.
In addition, any possible  learning effect associated with familiarization with  testing was minimized by the inclusion of an exer- cise test at the beginning and the end of the 30-day  prestudy period and by the use of a control group.
At study entry, most patients were receiving stan- dard medical therapy, but minor changes that could  have affected exercise performance did occur through- out the 24 weeks.
The ACE inhibitor dose was  increased in three patients in the exercise group and  was decreased in two patients in the control group.
These drugs can increase exercise duration (18), but  in these five patients, such an effect would have  been minimal.
In each patient, the dose was changed  and therapy with the drug was not stopped or started.
Although no exercise-related adverse events oc- curred during our study, the small sample size lim- ited our ability to quantitate risk.
Our findings on  safety, however, are consistent with those of previ- ous exercise trials that had similar sample sizes and  reported few, if any, training-related complications  (1, 2, 5-9, 17, 18, 20).
No data are available on the  long-term effect of regular exercise training on mor- bidity or mortality in patients with heart failure.
On the basis of our findings and the work of  other investigators, we conclude that there seem to  be no cardiac-related contraindications to exercise  training in patients with stable heart failure caused  by left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Exercise  training improved peak V02, peak heart rate, peak  ventilation, peak power output, and exercise dura- tion.
Much (46%) of the increase in peak V02 that  occurred in the exercise group was caused by the  increase in peak heart rate.
However, further study  is needed on the long-term benefit of exercise train- ing in these patients, including the effect of training  on the ability of patients to do routine activities of  daily living.
